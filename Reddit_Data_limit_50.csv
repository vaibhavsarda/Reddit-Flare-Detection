Lol,bjp is just embarrassing itself now! Well kejri shouldn't waste his time in stroking the ego of that Orange tumor and his wife anyway. I am sure he has better things to do. Petty af. Not a loss in my book though. Meeting a trophy wife of a nincompoop wannabe dictator achieves nothing. They can spend their time doing better things in the day. Insecurity level - Mudiji! Modi wants to show off the school as one of his own achievements instead of AAP's. This is just juvenile. Lol My previous manager at work used to do that. My team's ideas were presented to higher management but he would not forward the invite to us. He would get all credit. Modi is so petty ! Saala kitna insecure hai ! (How insecure is he !) Just a month ago modi and Shah were crying that there was no work done in Delhi schools. Now they are showing the schools off to the world.

Scheduled,Why the Supreme Court’s verdict on SC/ST quotas has created a political storm | It has upheld the state’s powers to deny reservations to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities.,107,f1o839,https://scroll.in/article/952687/why-the-supreme-courts-verdict-on-sc-st-quotas-has-created-a-political-storm,47,1581357646.0,,rahulthewall," Muslims and reservation are two distractions used by Indian elites to confuse people. These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. 




Honestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.

Looks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.


This alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.
Second they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.

This is the destruction of the act itself. 

Bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party

Who the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.
The reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.
On the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantage.

Reservations(if any) should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted."

I think it's a well known, well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in India.

Work environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal & external factors.

The commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this. 

Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?

What are your thoughts on such an initiative - does anyone reckon it will succeed here?",PuneriPerson," The single biggest minus point about Indian society is the non-existence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things.  

Such being the case, the 4 hour workday won't work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done. Japan and India are two entirely different animals.

Japan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.

In addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn't good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can't find enough people to work.

So a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.

India meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. 

Even when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.

Long story short: In Japan, employees are still a key human resource. In India, they are an expendable tool. Many times we have to work on weekends anyways. Can't think why that will change. And it won't matter if your clients work 5 days a week. Your opinion doesn't matter. [The decision has already been made](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-avoids-fixing-minimum-wage-in-draft-rules-suggests-9-hour-working-day-11572758439316.html).

> 26 days of work in a month

Which basically means 6 days a week.

So yeah, go fuck yourself. The Government has already decided 6 days a week, 9 hours a day for everybody. Bhai middle managers won't let this happen. Mandated 5 day work week would be a start. Apart from MNCs and few central government offices, everyone else works on Saturdays. also what would be the secondary effects of this move - as participation in hobbies, skill growth, lower commute \ traffic congestion - shall all have largely stimulating advantages in the overall environment. 

I am fascinated by what the results of such an experiment will be if implemented on a controlled, small scale. I think India would better benefit from more Work-from-home options. For example, come to office twice a week and wfh other days, especially in congested cities like bangalore. Now even Saturday and Sunday leave is a problem. Either you have to work om weekends due to some emergency or they load you with so much work and such deadlines that you end up working on weekend. If we deny the manager will say even we went through this or we will be simply released as there will be 1000s ready to work on saturday and sunday. Talk about negative competition. population (s)explosion That's like taking 3 steps at a time. First jobs need to be 6-8 hours long 6 days a week. Generally people are given ""work from home"" even on Sundays. Not to mention people work till 8 when they were supposed to be home by 5 or 6pm.

LOL. I was recently ghosted by a startup for letting them know I wasn't comfortable with their 6 day a week schedule (Monday to Saturday, every single week). Read on if you're interested.  

________________

**Back story -**

I recently interviewed at a startup for a tech role (Data Scientist) and was going through the final so-called ""cultural fit"" interview. I have almost 3 years of experience in the field. I currently work at a startup that works Monday to Friday (40 hours a week).   

Just doing my due diligence, I asked the interviewer if they work on Saturdays. To my disappointment, he said they do. Now, this was my 5th interview round. Not once did they tell me about their Mon-Sat schedule. I only got to know because I asked. 

For some context, this startup is 4 years old, have their product out in the market and have close to 30 employees (their claim - I was never invited to their office and all interviews happened on the phone in the course of a single week).   

As soon as I heard of their 6 day work schedule, I was disappointed. I mean, coming from a startup background myself, I understand the kind of hard work people need to put in every once in a while. Working on Saturdays during emergencies and other critical events is perfectly fine, but every single week? Come on! 

Oh, and I also would get **no** equity for my work there.  

But working on weekends wasn't necessarily a deal breaker to me. I just wanted to put myself in their shoes and know *why*. 

I mentioned to the guy upfront that my current organisation works 5 days a week, and that my life is built around a Mon-Fri schedule so it will be difficult to adjust to a 6 day work week.    

The guy must have realised my disappointment (this was on the phone), and so he started talking about how much potential this company has for growth and how much I could grow with the company. 


Anyway, I wanted to ask them their rationale for working every Saturday the next time we spoke, and also to evaluate for myself whether sacrificing my social life and hobbies for a job was worth it. 

Coincidentally, this conversation happened on a Friday, I got a text message the next day (Saturday), saying ""Let's close this today"". I had a long week and I switched off for the next two days and I didn't respond until Monday. I apologised for the delay, saying that I took some time off for the weekend and was ready for a discussion.    

That was it. I never heard from them again. I never said no to working on Saturdays, but still they ghosted me. I guess they wanted someone who would be submissive and not question their wisdom. 

Which is a shame, because the product (from what they told me, seemed interesting) but some of my friends say this was good riddance. Part of the problem is that our labour regulations and enforcement is, mildly put, absolutely terrible. Looking at indian labour laws is a crash course in the necessity of updating laws to new circumstances and the need to discard old laws in an expeditious manner rather than just getting by on the courts desperately trying to make the woefully inadequate laws fit the needs of today.

Even in sectors with massive deficits of required workers (such as medicine and law), the actual worker holds little power since regulations are lax and there's no one powerful actually standing up for them. A doctor or lawyer, especially one that's just starting out, will universally work long hours at the cost of his health; not because he's easily replaced, but because his managers are, for the most part, so inept that it would be tragic if it weren't hilarious. The iron law of wages is evident here for most to see.

Now how this can be remedied is a task in and of itself. It starts right from said horribly convoluted and loophole riddled regulations to the rather asinine practices of promoting professionals to managerial positions based on their ability to do their original job (a good doctor or lawyer isn't a good manager or leader) and linking payments to said promotions (which forces said professionals to seek such positions for better remuneration).

And yes, there's more to it than that, but the short answer is that the problem is very much systemic. This is as much cultural (if not more so) than it is economic. And that wages do not reflect demand or skill (otherwise we'd be paying the people who clean gutters more than any corporate CEO or hedge fund manager), they reflect status and power. 4 days working !! What a joke for Indian owners. I can see some of my friends are working on Saturdays also. Also, some are happy with their alternative Saturday holidays. I am sure as The sun that India will never implement this type of formula. Even government will do, Private company owners they will never spend a minute to think about it. You talking about 4 days working last month I worked on 2nd October without getting extra pay !! It's not like I'm talking about small towns this scene is available in one of the Metro city in India and only officially declared heritage city of India :) Would never work with our work ethic. Already mondays and fridays half the day is gone in either reaching late after leave travels or leaving early for leave travel. I still know people working in 6 days week. Even I used to work 6 days few years back. Let's make a uniform 5-day work week first. Better to learn to walk before attempting to run. I don't think that would work out over here. We've got a pretty laid-back work culture as is. most of the work in India is about availability and not about capability , our work culture is a reflection of it ( in both public and private sectors ) , Being specific to IT companies we are mostly cost centres which do really little productive work hence the moment we go for a 3 day weekend thereby increasing cost , these jobs will be outsourced to a cheaper location. Also apart from the '**highly questionable work culture**' we also suffer from highly questionable work ethic , as employees some treat their job as time-pass activity  working as seat warmers. For these people a 3 day weekend is pointless.

3 day weekend boost productivity which is amazing for people involved in demanding profiles, for this strategy to work in India we will need to have jobs that involve R&D ,planning or designing  . The problem is this kind of work demands attention and critical thinking, something our newer generation is quite not trained due to being spoon fed in schools with meaningless grades and ignored by professors in higher studies . Hence the 2nd thing will be reform our education system which emphasises more on thinking and less on following. It will work only if the office remains open six or seven days a week and there are alternate workers for those days which others have off.

That will kill both the unemployment problem and improve worker productivity. Might work where creativity is given large portion of importance..

For labour , essential services like hospital , it wont work , as this will hamper production in case of industries , and routine work procedure in case of health care industry. Service-based IT companies have their heads up their clients' asses. Middle and onsite managers make unrealistic promises to clients and make their subordinates work like a dog.

Much of this behavior stems from keeping their bosses happy, which was prevalent even during previous generations. So, I really don't see this happening until the time companies choose to treat their employees with respect. Yes, but only if people stopped the casual chit-chat over chai breaks, numerous smoke breaks, discussing cricket/politics breaks, taking personal calls at work breaks, hour long lunches and so on. [deleted] [deleted] Will it benefit the people? Yes, Of course.  
Will it benefit the companies? In the long run, yes.

I'd like to bring on a few points here:

* Japan is a labour shortage economy, yet the country is so culturally driven that loyalty and long working hours is a norm. You will find a huge faction of the workforce working for their first company throughout their career.
* India on the other hand is a labour surplus, and that too at the number one spot. In short, if you don't want to work long hours, there are literally thousands who would.
* This was done by just one company, Microsoft, which isn't even Japanese. They just tried it as an experiment, and 'might' do it again in the future.
* In a report produced a few months back, Indians turned out to be the employees taking the least holidays in the world. Technically it was correct, but didn't mention the procedures, the unapprovals, the interrogation involved with leaves in India. With such an approach of the organisations towards employees where taking leaves is ""not caring about the well-being of the organisation"", there's little hope of 4 day work-week.

I am a Senior Manager- Human Resources in one of the top media companies, and no matter what the terminology is - Human Resource, Human Capital, Personnel, Talent, Pink Squirrels, HiPots - the companies (there are exceptions) know that unemployment rates are high and that they can choose to treat employees like robots with little to no consequences. I have worked in a 4 day shift model back in 2008 and 2009, we had to trade off weekends. My working days used to be tue, fri,sat,sun. First implement 5 days, 8 hrs/day properly. Forget everything else. Work from Home once a week NEEDS to be a thing right now. Work culture is bad? 

Are you fucking kidding me? We Indians are lazy and most of teenagers and college going students that I have seen are complete morons. Even the new job takers have no skill and no desire to sit and learn.

If you think this is 'bad work culture and hard' then you are simply WEAK. Learn to fight. There are people surviving with no resources and you can't even survive and thrive after getting an excess of monthly income?! Shame on you And lose all that sweet outsourcing $$?

No, thank you very much. I'd rather jobs stay here than go to our Asian rivals. Use some basic sense.

We are a growing country and need to constantly do so just to keep up with the population growth let alone generating enough GDP to life people out of poverty.

Now imagine the whole indian work force stops working for one whole day every week? Does not even bear thinking about.

Everyone wants a work free chillax life, not everything the heart wants is good

Scheduled,Job Consultancy companies request PAN Card before scheduling interview and then cancel the interview after sending the resume and PAN card. Possible scam?,26,esd9js,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/esd9js/job_consultancy_companies_request_pan_card_before/,8,1579734505.0,"So my wife has been trying to attend interviews in the last couple of weeks, I have noticed a trend which kind of raises a red flag. 

The consultancy calls up for a potential opening in some company, they inform that the interview is next day and request to share the resume and PAN Card details. Once these information is sent, she gets a mail from the consultancy saying that this position is put on hold. 

It has happened three times already. It looks like some kind of scam. 

Why do they ask for PAN Card? Is it safe to provide the PAN Card? Can they do anything malicious with the PAN?",MasterApotheosis," This has happened to me. I got suspicious about and tried searching on Google and it indeed is a scam. 

I read somewhere that this companies need to show its workforce to clients companies to get the projects. By this way they can show inflated workforce without actually hiring that much no of people. A ghost employee to manipulate the balance sheet ! Never give your PII before the final round and compensation discussion

Send only to company HR email Id and not to consultants or agency Haven't you or your wife asked them why they need PAN before interview?

I don't know how PAN card can be misused but I wouldn't hand out any document like this. Yes"

Ok this is fine but wtf is this

Do they expect these two live a happy life after having seen the reaction by the husband? Is the taboo of divorce so strong? Still gullible Parents will force for Arranged Marriage. Singles enjoying this drama. 😂😂😂 Beat wife - yes

Have toxic relationship - yes

Have multiple partners - yes 

&#x200B;

Divorce - Fuck no - log kya bolega Shit like this happens more to people named ""Suresh"" The husband should thank the other guy for helping him dodge a bullet and call it a day. woman and lover can have sex but can’t marry each other, happily destroying another mans hopes. Why are people like this. HAHAHA

>  And the incident took place just days before the two were to consummate their wedding. 

Consummation:

> In many traditions and statutes of civil or religious law, the consummation of a marriage, often called simply consummation, is the first act of sexual intercourse between two people, either following their marriage to each other or after a short or prolonged romantic/sexual attraction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consummation I don't understand, why was this 'Rahul' guy arrested? So basically,

Now she can't be with the 'Rahul' guy because he leaked an intimate video, no resao of going back to him.

Suresh won't keep her either. Why should he? 


This just went tits up.

CMMI Level 5 processes even during sex. Did they also fix a date when the conception would occur and for the child to be born? Guys even if you do shit.. don't fucking post it on Social Media. Keep shit private. This looks like something Times would make up for pageviews. Lately, they have been twisting facts, especially around Corona to create sensational news. Shame on these guys. No wonder people refer to Times as Toilet Paper. Guys, don't go for arranged marriages. Made in heaven - Part 2 Guy has a chance to pull out, literally The problem here is not so much the woman and her family, as the ridiculously biased, anti-men laws in this country. 

Do you guys know that if a woman dies within 7 years of marriage, the investigation has to be done by a magistrate under [Section 304B of the IPC](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/653797/), and the presumption of guilt is on the husband by default? Which means - the man will be assumed guilty by default. All your wife has to do is make some cuts and bruises on herself and the courts assume she committed suicide because of dowry harassment, and will send you to jail for 7+ years.

Our law still operates in the 19th century mindset, according to which all women are angels, capable of no wrongdoing, and must be protected from the evil men in society who are out to get them. Oh, and they can never have any premarital or extramarital relationships - they all are virtuous virgins by default.

In this country if you are ever wronged by a woman, it is better to shut your mouth and take it quietly. If you look to the law for recourse, the law will smack you down, throw you in a dark dingy prison and probably champion the verdict as a victory for women's rights. I mean why How can you call the cops if someone is cheating? Is this even valid? The reddit jury would like to view this ""porn clip"" as evidence, please and thank you [deleted]"
Scheduled,People are still hoarding,62,fx3t1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx3t1t/people_are_still_hoarding/,27,1586368858.0,"I went to Dmart today morning. They had a long queue of people ( atleast 150), maintaining physical distance,  waiting to buy the essential items. And, each and every person was buying in bulk, hoarding essential items so that they don't have to wait in huge queue again. 

 As I entered the supermarket after waiting for almost 1.5 hrs in the heat of Mumbai, I could hear some people mildly coughing, sneezing  and Dmart staff advising them to take their supplies and leave fast. I think we may  have reached Stage 3 and Supermarkets are new hotbeds for COVID-19.",spez666," I think now would be a good time to go back to pre mart Era practices. A single window dispensing the items. You pre-book whatever you need and pick it up at scheduled time. Of course this would be easier for smaller towns and villages but with proper coordination and management it can be done in bigger cities as well. Things would not be as bad of the authorities did not prevent you from moving out to get your stuff like they are doing now Is buying a week's ration for family of 4 hoarding? Well, if you are a family of 4-6 and are buying a week's worth of supplies it would seem like hoarding to someone who lives alone. Most people aren't hoarding in India, they have medium to large families so they buy in bulk. Buying a week's worth of vegetables alone fills up 2 large bags for a family of 4-5. This isn't hoarding. The current recommendation in a lot of countries is to buy a weeks grocery at a time, so you don't ha e to leave home any more often than that. If you think about how much a joint family goes through in a week, it might seem like hoarding, but it's actually the recommended strategy. I think the whole idea about hoarding is that you don't have to get out of your house anytime soon, so that you can have your supplies stocked up, but yes you're right it is probably the new hotbet for the virus Better to buy from the friendly neighborhood baniya. For this same reason iam avoiding going to crowded or popular supermarket, going to lesser known or less crowded seems better and they have a lot items available due to less coming to them There's no clarity when and how the lockdown will end. There are no assurances from government and in times of opaque information flow, chaos will ensue. I think taking as much as you can store and keep is a good idea.. It minimizes the number of times you need to go out and reduces the risk of your own exposure, your family's exposure and the chances of you spreading to others in case you're an asymptomatic carrier..

You're going to use it over the next week or two weeks anyways, as long as you don't let it spoil, so it evens out. You're not depriving anyone, you're reducing chances of infection. Big Bazaar in my Town does home delivery. I bought stuff for months. Noo, ICMR clearly states ""no community transmission yet"""
Scheduled,The Continuing Practice of Untouchability in India.,2600,eptyqa,https://i.redd.it/91hssr5m29b41.jpg,643,1579256965.0,,Gavthi_Batman," My state, Manipur might have perrenial conflicts but I am proud, there is no practice of untouchability. Jai Maharashtra I used to be so confused about untouchability when I was little. I used to hear how the untouchables were mistreated by almost everyone. I thought why don't they just riot or fight those people mistreating them, after all they can't touch the untouchables! Later someone told me you could still touch them with sticks and stones. Damn, I was so ignorant. I live in a semi Village locality in West Bengal,can confirm most of the household still practice untouchability. Mostly with the maids of their house. I would like to see the correlation with percentage of 12th standard educated students. It's probably very high.

There is a reason why politicians don't like a well educated populace. Stupid people are easily manipulated into forming tribes and fighting each other. I’m curious to know what in Kerala and Bengals history was different from the Hindi belt. I’m surprised Maharashtra is so radically different from surrounding states. You would think that the border regions would have some sort of gradient in attitudes... Come on Cow belt. Please change. We are in 21st century **SOURCE:**

>An extensive study by Amit Thorat teaches economics at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Omkar Joshi is a doctoral scholar at the Department of Sociology, University of Maryland, Washington on **The caste (jati)-based practice of untouchability in India.**

>This article is based on nationally representative data of 42,152 households, surveyed in 2011–12, which, for the first time, asked direct questions on caste and the practice of untouchability. This data is part of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), a panel survey conducted in 2004–05 and 2011–12, which is a joint undertaking of the National Council of Applied Economic Researchand the University of Maryland.

>The household schedule of the 2011–12 IHDS posed the following question to the primary respondent of each of the enumerated survey households: “Do some members practise untouchability in your household?” The respondent’s answer was recorded as a “Yes/No” response. In case the response was a “No,” it was followed by the second question: “Would there be a problem if someone who is a Scheduled Caste were to enter your kitchen or share utensils?,” again seeking a “Yes/No” response. Any household that responded in the affirmative to both or either of the two questions was regarded as practising untouchability.

Economically sound hai to reservation ki kya zaroorat
Padha Likha hai , reservation ki vajah se isko Kuch Nahi AATA Hoga
Kaam ekdum (insert lower caste name) Jaise

I still remember when we lived in UP ,the house maid found out that we are dalit ,she left the work next day and same day we were asked to vacate the house. When we vacated the house my dad told me the landlords cleaned the whole house with Ganges water. Word got out and my family was socially ostracized , suddenly friends stoped talking to me. teachers called me with casteist slurs.
It was a living nightmare we had to leave the city

Now I still have to lie about my caste everywhere I go ,they all act progressive but in reality they are the backward ones

The most hilarious thing is people are ready to drink cow urine but won't touch food made by an untouchable Kerala of 1800s and early 1900s were extremely casteist, probably one of the worst in the country even. I haven't heard of practices like [breast tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Tax) happening anywhere else other than Kerala. It's amazing how much we progressed in the last 60-70 years. Still, caste is not going anywhere, even in Kerala. It has gone more covert though. What I've noticed is that, many people from outside Kerala starts to probe about one's caste openly the moment you meet them. I've never experienced such things while I lived in Kerala. Unsurprisingly, it correlates with high GDP per capita and better HDI. I'm from M.P. and sc caste and i have seen people making bad/weird faces when knowing my last name. And i have seen my classmates discriminating sc/st people on the basis of reservation (""iska kya hai ye to bina padhe likhe bhi reservation se pass ho jayega/jayegi) The south seems to be far better. Interesting fact: Majority of the Hindu immigrants/refugees who will benefit from CAA are Dalits from Bangladesh, now living in Assam and West Bengal. BJP is a bit [two-faced](https://thewire.in/caste/the-two-faces-of-hindutvas-dalit-agenda) when it comes to Dalits. My district in Assam has close to 0%,feels good. I guess it correlates with education,we have the highest/2nd highest literacy rate in the State. How do they get this data? I am not questioning the validity of data. But I don't think they went house 2 house asking if people practice untouchability. These are depressing statistics Wtf whats up with some parts of himachal and uttrakhand? Thought my states didnt had it this bad. Nice to see my home state doing good-ish here. Still 5% is 5% too much. Shit needs to stop. I am noticing a pattern when it comes to every major problem in India. Way to go --- dont forget your Northeast Indians --- they have put aside these old beliefs --- Hindi heartland could learn a thing or two.

One observation is the long-time communist run states like Kerala and W.Bengal and the emphasis on education --- most commendable for Kerala given what its historic caste structure and history of oppression has been, even W.Bengal with the oppressive Zamindari history.

Maharashtra is interesting --- there is a common Marathi identity greater than other identifiers, possibly also the higher penchant for industry and economics.

Just my 2 paise trying to understand how this can be explained. No more claiming of North is Progressive and South is Conservative!  
Being conservative is good if you are Progressive within. In the context of this study, how are ""households practising untouchability"" defined? I was trying to see what it was from the link to the IHDS-II data, but I'm not savvy enough to figure it out.

In any case, I'm pleasantly surprised that Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, and quite a few places in the North-East (except for the ones with no data) appear to have massively reduced the practice of untouchability in their regions. My state WB seem to do pretty well . If the data is right and good sample size is considered I'm aure it'll be even better. Maharashtra Kerala and Bengal along with the far Eastern frontier states seems considerably exceptional. Pretty predictable. But did no Jyotiba Phule or Rammohan Roy or Vidyasagar emerge in these northern states? I mean, damn look at the amount of red... pretty depressing for India as a whole... Source: [https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf](https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf) In case anyone wants to learn more, the documentary India Untouched offers a deeper look into untouchability and the way it's practiced in different parts of the country. Really informative and insightful. Again, not surprising that the places also map out with [where the BJP won](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election#/media/File%3AIndian_General_Election_2019.svg). South India is far more progressive, clearly. I love how the colour for 0% and no data is the same.   
TN's scenario isn't as bad as I thought. Still pretty bad considering it looks more like a north Indian state than a south Indian state from this map. Its funny that people are supporting CAA and NRC to give prosecuted minorities from neighboring countries citizenship while there are far more minorities inside the country who face discrimination and what not on a daily basis but no one cares for their pain.
Makes me wonder if the CAA and NRC is just a political stunt for vote bank or the govt really cares about the minorities. And mainland Indians have the audacity to think that the Eastern states are junglee and un-civillised. 


Completely fed up of this bigotry. How has no one mentioned Bengal, as clean(no red spots) as Maharashtra if not more. The reforms that started here spread to the villages with the 40 year communist rule instilling the values into deeper sections of society and peripheral villages too. I'm not a proponent of hardcore communism, but I feel it has had it's share of good effects amongst the many bad ones. As a North Easterner, we have our issues but mainland cancer like dowry and caste system doesnt have a foothold. Also, people eat whatever the F they want without fear of lynching! It is a tragedy that despite Dalits being more reformed in maharastra , they never attained political power like Dalits of UP, Bihar where Dalits have their own mainstream party.

All credit goes to Sharad pawar who ensure that Dalits never get mobilised. This is actually not a good measure as in reality, the figures would be much higher as many practice it but deny it Go Kerala! I'm a malayalee mumbaikar, I didn't even know this was still a thing One interesting thing I noticed is that even though this is a per-district depiction, the trends nearly line up cleanly according to the state borders.

This goes to show how the standardized mini-subcultures within each state influence people's values. The case of Bengal, Kerala, and Maharashtra is especially striking relative to their neighbhors. I hope there will be a time where it's gone completely. Proud to see Maharashtra being a progressive in this regard. wait, that looks like South Indians are more progressive and have liberal views than North India. I am shocked at Haryana. I thought they would be higher in list. *Funny how Gujarat is still a major contributor to this even considering it is the homestate of the country* I Lepe forgetting maharashtra is above Karnataka, they don't talked about much. don't know when India Will be free of all these things Very happy to see kolhapur in the white Extremely surprised to see Jains had the highest ""Yes"" percentage at 35%. I've generally considered Jains to be relatively socially forward but I guess I've been living in a liberal bubble. This is honestly very disappointing. It's 2020 now, and the practice of untouchability is still prevalent? Honestly, by now you'd thin the education system would have worked at least a little. Feels good by seeing the data for Maharashtra.
We believe in humanity and the youth of Maharashtra doing good job by spreading the humanity message. Growing up in MP, I lived in the decently sized city of Jabalpur. My dad was a police officer back when we were in India, and he got posted to a police station out in a village somewhere. The place was about an hour drive, so we used to go there on weekends or when we didn't feel like going to school.

This one time, during summer vacation, we were there for maybe 3 weeks. My brother and I used to go out and play in the fields or whatever all day long. This one time him, a few other friends, and I were playing around where we got our feel all covered in mud. After we were done, before we going home we decided to stop at this hand pump to wash out feet. We waited while this outer kid, around our age, was filling up about 3 matkas with water. He filled them all up, and left with 2 of them and said he'll be right back. While he was gone, I decided to wash my feet (his 3rd matka was out of the way). He comes back, see's me washing my feel, and gets pissed the fuck off. He doesn't say anything to me (since my father was the police incharge of the area), but he did say something to one of our friends in a Hindi dielect I didn't understand and then he threw out all the water from the matka. Confused, I asked my friend what was going on? He said this guys is from some higher caste, and they don't drink or eat anything that has come into contact with someone from a lower cast. I said I'm not even Hindu, I'm Sikh. He said since he doesn't know your caste, he's treating you as a lower caste and will refill the water.

That's when I realized shit like untouchability and caste system is still alive and well in India. An obvious and visible form of untouchability would be less harmful than invisible form where higher casts do not show they are treating lower cast people in an inferior manner but just not include  them in daily activities. Pleasantly surprised seeing Maharashtra stand alone seeing surrounded by a sea of red.

Also surprised it's not all white in Kerala. Have heard of pockets in Kasargod area that drops into Karnataka. Work needs to be done.

Extremely shocked seeing TN though. Source is from University of Maryland. Are there any citations for this research? Vegetarianism is directly proportional to Caste system if we go by this chart Anyone surprised by Gujrat being in same category as UP, Bihar? Not me. Just curious, why is the North always kinda backwards? I guess it takes a long time for people to break traditional bigotry like it does racism, generations. How is this measured? How do they collect data for this one? By asking people ? Source ? Telangana isn't quite there yet but hey, we're getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Nagaland? Really ? Which year or when was it conducted? As expected from Amiths Maharashtra looking so fair and lovely, but my home state odisha makes me sad end classism If you see south indians and west Indians are very intelligent Bengal has a lot of bad things but on this one it doesn't disappoint much , I'm curious about South Bengal because personally I haven't heard about it. Proud to be from Kerala!!! Cow belt ftw The cow-belt is clearly visbile here.


Apparently making people eating beef will ensure they don't practice untouchability :)

It would also improve their literacy & give the people brains to elect better leaders.

/s Proud to be a Maratha Can someone overlay the 2019 election result over this map ? How old is this? Telangana's borders aren't on this map. Feeling Ashamed from Himachal Pradesh. I belong to the western part, Dharamshala. But the sad thing is that  so called modern areas like Shimla, Manali and Mandi are dark. It's always interesting seeing the correlation between bigotry and distance from the coast. proud of my state(Maharashtra) ^_^ As you go south , Indians get wiser . Marathi people have strong character. Well proud to be from state of Maharashtra. Land of Reformers. Shivaji Maharaj, Mahatama Jyotirao Phule, Savatri  Phule, Gokhale, ....... its huge.

Shahu Maharaj a prominent King(1874-1920) and more a reformer who setup different boarding school for different community. Abolished Mahar act, appointed non brahmin for Vedic  education, Supported Dr ambedkar during his struggling period. Free education to all during his regime. Shahu Maharaj arranged intercaste marriage of his sister  **Chandraprabhabai.**

&#x200B;

These all contributed greatly towards decreasing of untouchablilty in Maharashtra. Ah, MP is the hidden thug, often outshined by classic thugs like UP & Bihar, thanks to their massive population. 

Apart from less population density, MP is just another UP-Bihar,  it’s poor (gdp per capita: India ~$1,900, MP- $1,300, UP- $1000, Bihar - $900), has lower average literacy - 69% (2011) and it’s casteist and belongs to cow belt.

Edit; Cow belt aside Odisha & Assam have higher untouchablity practices in districts with high tribal populations (southern Odisha & eastern Assam). Is it a coincidence that all red marked states are mostly under BJP government? Look at the cow belt Nagaland? Are you kidding? First of all, we don't even have a caste system. Second of all, the indigenous people of the state mainly practice Christianity and untouchability has its roots in the Hindu caste system. I'm not really sure but besides Christianity, I suppose people in some of the far-flung places worship nature, so there's that.

But even then, if there is any validity to this data, I can vouch for the fact that this isn't because of the indigenous people. It is probably because of the migrants from other parts of India that's causing this. I haven't been much to Maharastra in my life. Any good reasons why it's so progressive in this metric? The caste system is here to stay so long as people feel proud about having born into their respective caste. Kerala Gang Rise Up My state is in a very dire state Telangana isn't quite there yet but hey, we're getting there.. some progress is better than no progress Very true and disappointing. It is so bad that a majority of people have accepted it the way it is. But there's hope from folks like we have in this community. dated? Can you provide link of this survey ? I just want to share it with other guys. Is this for 2019? How did theh even collect the Data Very disappointing picture, the middle horizontal strip area of India is still suffering with this problem. I believe educated has to play a great role to eradicate this menace. These data are chocking for everyone, a lot of work still needed This is a ten year old dataset Op, can you give us some insight on the questions asked in that survey? This just makes the case, north India is the shitty part How was this data collected any link to the source ? [deleted] The fact that the cow belt is not just red color is a victory, cannot expect any more.., How are such data ever gathered? 

I am genuinely curious. This is depressing. How about some religious artwork to cheer ppl up Surprised Telugu states are on the lighter side. I wonder how the data would look for the age below 30 Could very well be BJP rules states map. 

Oh wait. To be honest, I've never seen untouchability in Punjab. Awful seeing this. [removed] People commenting on north/south india, casually ignoring north-east..as usual Meanwhile my parents rejecting an arranged marriage proposal where the girl is from untouchable class. J&k is white due to snow You know us North Indians are the root of the problem when it's more concentrated in our area. Proud of my state West Bengal. And all the cow belt states are dragging India behind... #Gutkha-khods Interesting to see Punjab that low. Sikhism? Peasants and their problems West Bengal :-) North India still stuck in the stone age, while South focuses on education and development. if you notice it's the north side :pwe southerners are humble people lul Would be interesting to see the data for literacy rate and per capital along with this I don't understand why North India is so backward. South Is way better in almost everything. Can you explain what it means to an American Sikh? Goddamn I’m proud of Kerala! Non-Indian here, isn't untouchability prohibited by the Constitution? I though this bs died put long ago Would someone be kind enough to ELI5 the “Practice of Untouchability” in India for a foreigner coming in from r/all? me: * a north indian *

also me: those goddamn north indians 😤 mera bharat mahan Which year's data is this ? What is untouchability? Wow! We as a country Can't grow unless we get united. What does Household Practicing mean? That untouchability is practiced in households?? In brazil we just call them poor people jai jai maharashtra maza [deleted] wtf is Gujrat and Rajasthan doing? Hey American here. I’ve had classes on the class systems of India but am by far no expert and those were years ago. Was wondering if someone could explain this and if it still has to do with traditional ideals or if there is a different drive for it in present times? Any answers are appreciated. India world power 2020, biggest joke of the year Just by looking at the map, it doesn't seem to correlate with economic progress. I'm very keen to know what other metrics they can do stats with. That's the worst thing we are continuing in India. Okay. I find this hard to believe. It could be the ratio of people that believe in the caste system, but who even practices untouchability still? So crazy, as a westerner who visited India last year I had no clue this was still happening. Its so hard to pick up on all of the nuances and I guess many tourists just boil it all down to 'crazy shit everywhere' and 'chaos' haha.

 Quite sad to see that still takes place. This is shocking... when will the people learn. What is untouchability?? Hope it's more white now since the data has to be atleast 5 years old as telengana is not shown as a state . Himachal has high literacy rate and hight untouchability. 👏 Cow belt being cow belt doing gobar practices As a Tamilan, I feel ashamed. Almighty will free whole the country from Untouchability in India!! Sab Changa Si, can you free India from Untouchability si???"

We believe it’s super important for Indians to stay level-headed & use this lockdown as an opportunity to spend some quality time with their families. In India, as we grow older and start working, we often forget about our old hobbies & the things which we used to enjoy when we were younger. 

This lockdown will last a minimum of 21 days, and everyone needs to find quality activities to fill their schedule with & things to enjoy with their families.


To solve this, [we've launched IndiaSmile](https://indiasmile.org/): A one-stop resource for the best things to do while stuck in quarantine, with a unique indian context. What's more, it's 100% non-profit and open source!


It contains:

* Best movies and TV shows to watch -- Hindi & English

* Home workout tutorials for Cardio, Yoga, Strength, and flexibility.

* Guides and apps for managing anxiety and social isolation

* Community chat to discuss & engage with

* Unbiased, scientific news

* Learning resources 


We're trying to benefit the community by providing carefully curated lists of content to consume and resources to follow, regularly updated by a team of dedicated citizens.


The IndiaSmile WhatsApp communities section aims to provide more social connections by only permitting authentic and positive content. 


We have also added [a tool to check the nearest confirmed covid case to your current safe location](https://indiasmile.org/nearme/).

How does the nearest confirmed case tool work? Are the whatsapp groups any active ? The last tip is incorrect:

> Do not wear a facemask if you arent sick
>
> You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

Increasingly, this is proving to be bad advice (even though it is WHO-supplied), and face masks are shown to reduce transmission. Doesn't have to be N95, even a cloth or handkerchief will help.

From [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322931/):

> S. Wearing masks outside the home in a reference period corresponding to the 2 weeks before symptom onset for cases was significantly protective against clinical SARS. Supporting the validity of this finding, there was a dose-response effect: by multivariable analysis, persons who always wore masks had a 70% lower risk of being diagnosed with clinical SARS compared with those who never wore masks, and persons with intermittent mask use had a 60% lower risk. Many persons who wore masks in the community did not use N-95 or similar highly efficient filtration devices, which have been recommended for use in the hospital setting.

Just one suggestion, specially related to the updates WhatsApp group

Can you do this on Telegram, because it is impossible to get ""older"" information on WhatsApp groups. You can scroll up n see stuff on Tele from before you joined.

Thank you [deleted] Great initiative guys. Found one small thing though, your old hindi songs page has a Punjabi playlist. Joined 2 whatsapp communities as well let's see how that plays out Excellent site and excellent post. How did this start?

What about games.you something similar to flash games that we used to have earlier as a quick refresher Is it a good idea to teach people how to torrent pirated stuff in the movie section? Its illegal and can get them as well as your team arrested. Not to mention our networks are already overloaded enough as it is. I loved the design on my phone, perhaps the most responsive mobile  website I've seen. Also +1 for no ads. how about a list of novels/books to read? Nice.

You guys should consider adding 'Khosla ka Ghosla' in the movies list somewhere. Loved the HIMYM pic you've used to represent Tv series, usually it's GoT I would love to contribute. Amazing! One suggestion you can add a general aged group based online learning material. I see this is Open source. I'll try forking. Great work. You are a good man OP! Maybe add a foriegn section for movies and series'? I can help with the suggestions. Are you collecting & storing any user location & personal data when people access the listed web site?
Asking as no user privacy & data usage policy is listed on site. Great stuff, thanks for doing this and sharing here.

I was wondering if having a music related WhatsApp group will also make sense, I always wanted to  hear from like-minded folks what music they are hooked on to and share my choices. Alternatively, you could just masturbate all day and try to speed run doom on the highest difficulty"

Is the nearby town safe at midnight for family?",Direct_Equivalent," I am assuming by car.

Unless you are like a real enthu astro/aero geek. I wouldn't recommend esp with family. More than safety, it will be very tiring, if you are trying to drive up and down in one shot.

If you break it up into 2 night trip it will be better idea. Pulikat lake is quite a sight esp if the birds are in town. Find a decent hotel within 1hr distance along the highway. Town everything will be booked up esp for this launch.

There is just one road leading to the site and security will stop you 5-6 km away, but you can take the mud road along the lake to the right of that security check point and find a good place to sit.

There are hundreds of people these days who watch from that road. It's not crowded or anything because its a very large lake bed and you can see the launch from any point along that road.

Also go post/read on r/isro you might find a lot more details from others  there.

If its not cloudy and weather is good, a night launch is pure magic. I want the answers too. Do we need to buy a ticket or something? Heard from someone that you could buy tickets couple of months before the launch.

I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding.",zafar_bull," Well if the protest ends here then its a amit shah victory he got a new template.... dangay karao protest khatam and you will see that applied all over india. If someone is protesting peacefully against injustice they have every right I understand and empathize with your perspective. However, if you want the protest to end, that means you are okay with giving up the only resistance there exists against the CAA. Without the protests (and essentially no one being outraged), the Act gets implemented silently and obediently, and you are at the mercy of this genocidal government. You are okay with atrocities being committed against people of your religion and possibly you yourself. There is literally no other fight available to people right now other than peaceful protesting, even if it may eventually lead to nothing. At least it keeps international media attention on India and possibly reduces the damage inflicted on Muslims or postpones it. Unless you have a better alternative than protesting.

If you are okay with protesting, but not in Shaheen Bagh because it makes your life more difficult, and would rather that the protests moved elsewhere in a different locality, your argument is selfish, albeit valid, but undoubtedly selfish. And there's no merit in that for me, sorry. You would rather that someone else gets inconvenienced and threatened, and while of course that may be a natural reaction, it is not very endearing. No, OP. 

Do you think that if all protests end , the hatred will stop? 

No. 

Do you know what bjp's no. 1 weapon is? 

It is hate. Hate will always exist in people's hearts unless these hindutva goons sitting in the Centre are thrown. We need everyone in our country to realise that hateful hyper nationalism is very bad. Oppression is very bad. 


And it is only achievable through protests. Times are hard now but trust me when I say that this protest is the only reason people have hope right now. They already had the chronology planned they always had the plan to attack the minorities. We all know what they wanted. But the protest made a revolt against them and people not only from minorities but also the majority of Hindu’s started joining. This protest is not between Hindu and muslims. Its a protest of the educated vs the oppressor. They want you to go weak and they will land the first blow. But they cant take away the hope and the unity of the people because religion comes after humanity. You can be a muslim or a hindu but firstly we’re an Indian and we learnt to respect all the religions. I understand your opinion and perspective but I have a question for you. Would you also advice women in your house to cooperate with the rapist to reduce the pain in case someone attacks them? We've seen similar events play out in Indian history multiple times. But just taking events which have been done by the duo at the helm of the country right now:

* If Gujarat is any indication, there might be pogroms in the future for Muslims followed by segregated housing (similar to Ahmedabad).

* If Assam is any indication, the NRC process will be brutal, imprecise and disproportionately affect poor people.

* If the Kashmiri Pandit exodus/genocide is any indication, the (current) ruling party is willing to just keep using some token crowd as a political prop to suit its agenda without actually doing anything for them.

* If modern Kashmir is any indication, the government is willing cut off basic necessities (e.g. internet) for months just to enforce their police state, jail people without reason etc.

* If the demonetization is any indication, the government is willing to put its own citizens at huge risk just to win an election (UP election) and on the basis of some tinpot economics.

If you look at other events in Indian history (Sikh riots, Kashmiri Pandit exodus, Mumbai riots of 1993, 1983 Nellie massacre) we can see the patterns emerge here as well.

We've seen such events play out elsewhere in the world too. India is not unique in this respect.

The NRC-CAA process preceded by a pogrom? Your documents will burn in your houses and then you'll be forced to somehow produce those documents to prove your citizenship. It'll leave a lot of casualties - and now only the non-Muslims will get citizenship back through CAA. You go to a 'detention' camp.

This is an existential crisis for Muslims so I'm not surprised that they are taking to the streets...

Let's not forget this

         Because I was not a socialist.

> -Martin Niemoller You have put into words what I have been feeling for the longest time.

Our route is (in that order): New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Kanpur, Varanasi, Kolkata and we want to use trains to move between them. On one hand it's safer and more robust to book everything online and not worry about the ticketing, but on the other we want to be flexible since nothing goes as planned.

What would you recommend? What's your experience?",5hrp," Travelling in trains in India on non-reserved tickets is not something you would want to do. 

There's only about a month left so you better hurry and book your tickets on www.irctc.co.in otherwise you would not even get a reserved ticket.

To have a better idea about what type of tickets to book, search for 'What does 1A, 2A, 3A, SL, CC, 2S mean in Indian trains'. I would recommend you to book 3AC tickets.

Edit: You can book tickets 1 day before train's departure day under Tatkal quota too but it's risky and its costs extra money. Tickets can be sold out in under 5 minutes after it opens. You will get tickets easily even in Tatkal a day before while you are travelling Kanpur to Varanasi and Varanasi to Kolkata. 
I always used to take tickets a day before while I was living in Kolkata and coming to Varanasi my hometown. 

One of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .

If nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.  I would suggest you to book confirm ticket now, if it is available. You can cancel it later, if there is a change of plan and book a Tatkal ticket. 

You can text me if you want more information about the places to visit or any help or have any confusion regarding these cities. Get the NTES app on your phone for live train status. It's the official app and it's good. Do you have a non Indian passport ? Foreigners have a quota in most major trains and you can purchase reserved tickets under this category from major train stations like New Delhi Railway station. It might be difficult to find seats in regular category on trains if you use the online route as trains get booked fairly in advance. Goodluck !

Add : Guwahati, Nehru Park 4PM Just a reminder - from past experience during Lok Pal Bill protests and Nirbhaya protests - outcome wasn't end of corruption and rape - best outcomes happened where Organizations got built. And Connections between various orgs were strengthened.

Know (build awareness of) the various orgs in your region and help build connections between them.

Initially 3 people might show up from each, then 10 then 100 as violence and unacceptable behavior increases.

When the next round happens, and it will, the more organized people and groups are govt starts backing down from instant automatic reactions.

Whether it is student bodies - legal - social - cultural  - ngos - media - trade unions - industry bodies(each sector has one) - govt unions, as soon an event occurs knowing who the contact person is and showing them what your group is planning and ways their orgs can get involved, will change peoples understanding of how our new networked society can respond to misuse of Power.

https://twitter.com/NrcProtest/status/1214091227475267584?s=09 Mods, please sticky this. We need more people to go out and fight fascism.  The point of relay protests is to maintain a continual, peaceful resistance without a reduction in numbers. To do this, people take turns to participate, rest, and rejoin, much like relay races.

Unlike rallies, relay protests usually take place at a fixed spot. People bring supplies such as food and sleeping bags to stay for long periods of time.

Relay protests are much more likely to attract media attention without disrupting peace and order. This is due to their long-term, continuous nature. People's determination and dedication to the cause shines through. Especially in cases like Shaheen Bagh, where the protests continued despite the nail-biting winters of the North through Christmas and New Year's.

Scheduled,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,684,eogkmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,343,1579006550.0,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",VelvetHedgehog," People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzuKz1fuQg

However, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their ‘non-Indianess’ for in their logic such people could only be ‘Chinese’ If you want to see how Caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than Tamil Nadu. The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian. Majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of Tamilians working are Brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by Brahmins. For those that don’t know, this is Dalit cuisine

Would you eat this? Perhaps if you were starving and nothing else was available to you? That is why these people started eating them! [removed] I’m not telling everyone to eat non-veg, beef or pork. I know the last two are unfathomable for most of us. However, those that want to eat them should have no restrictions. There never used to be any such laws before and this was the traditional diet of many communities Gai doodh nahi deti hai, hum usse le lete hai. Spot on. It's not like we are an animal or nature-loving society otherwise. It's all caste, masquerading as lifestyle choices. I belong to small backwards village in UP where we didn’t have electricity until a few years ago

Outside our village was a basti of the Chamars

They certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers. All they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both Hindus and Muslims without discrimination. I am haunted by a moment when I was around 10 years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and I was greedily eating it like a pig while a boy the same age as me but from the Chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and I still remember the look on his father’s face. His father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man. My mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and ‘najar nahi lagegi’ 

They ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice a pig every year to their caste god. They also ate the flesh of all dead animals. They ate lizards, jackals, mongoose I don't get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it I mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people, I will never get the cow thing it's so stupid. 
My great grandfather(Brahmin) moved to West Bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic. I hope someday we can see through this bs it's a domesticated animal people stop getting offended. I am sorry but you are using the words ""Indian"" and ""caste"" very vaguely. I am an upper caste Brahmin from the Bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste. In fact even the ""pujari"" eats non veg after doing puja, in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat. Also, same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and a lot of other tantric sects as well. 

It is only a few ""elitist"" brahmins (mostly vaishnavites). Who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of Hinduism. We are a very vast culture with many schools of thought we can't demean Hinduism entirely just because a part of it is very casteist. We need to learn, re-write and re-narrate Hinduism to the masses.

There is a lot of hindutva propaganda. But let's try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters. 

PS: I did upvote because you started a great convo here. We need more and more diverse voices Just like everything else in india Such hypocrisy is ripe in India and I personally feel there is a need for drastic change that would make the society casteless and classless may be I’m wrong but it’s time for a change in mindset of people. Of course most people in this country don't actually care about animals. We all see and ignore the plight of street animals every single day. By that argument are Jains and Bhuddists also forcing vegetarianism ? Or is it only the Brahmins who are espousing vegetarianism on everyone. 

Kshatriyas were warriors and kings. They ate meat. So to say vegetarianism has to do a lot with casteism is being a bit dishonest. 

Indian cuisine is one of the few which organically has so much vegetarian food choices instead of just meat substitutes. It is sad that even that is used to fuel hatred on this sub. 

Hope you find peace OP. What is this? Bootleg scroll article? This write up is sprinkled with gems like,

>Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power **being forced on** the non-vegetarian majority – **with their consent**.

Da fuq.

Another gem,

>The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Hmm what?? Why is this nonsense just there right in the middle without any preface and conclusion?

And wonderful theorem proving techniques. To prove,

>**Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals**

Goes on to assume the same thing,

>The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity.

*Proof:* Assume theorem is true => Theorem is true now. Done<>

&#x200B;

There are many things wrong with caste, but vegetarianism isn't one of them. So vegetarianism is bad because of Brahmins? I feel nowadays caste based vegetarianism is like forced practice I have friends who belong to the swami caste yet they eat meat and stuff outside in secret and practice vegetarianism at home. This is pure BS.  

People are non vegetarian because that comes naturally to them and easily accessible. In today's world we don't even need to rely on meat as we can get majority of required supplements with veg counterparts and remaining can be found in eggs. Most Baniyas/Vaishyas are vegetarian. Kshatriyas have a high percentage of meat eaters. Any “ism” is more about moral superiority than the real thing. Absolutely. We're a hypocritical bunch with dung for brains. If we had the sense to look beyond Brahmin India, we'd see how people thrive with non-vegetarian food in their diets. It's beyond cringe to see our athletes against say, Australian or New Zealand athletes. When we moved to the UK initially we had the problem of halal haram coming from a Muslim family but later we decided to abandon these customs for a few reasons:

1. In this country you cannot see the animal being slaughtered, so you do not really know if it is halal and since most of the animals are stunned beforehand, it so not valid. Thus you cannot be sure of the provenance of meat even if it is from a halal animal

2. It is not convenient to be restricted to certain foods. We lived in a White British area and not some Desi ghetto where everything is halal or vegetarian. Most of the things I grew to like actually consumed pork such as sausages, pate,  etc. Which either my parents knew had pork but did not care or they really didn’t know

3. Islamophobia and also the mentality of most Muslims in modern times makes me want to distance myself from them

4. Me and my father, mother are technically atheist or agnostic, so why not eat pork?

5. I used to try to be vegetarian as far as possible but I love meat too much so it didn’t last long I'm an avid non vegetarian. I don't crave pork or mutton coz i much rather prefer the chicken-egg-fish combo.

If you have to bring it up to castes well even among the so called brahmins there are sub casts and I happen to belong to top of them. And in my entire region, across casts and whatever subsections you want to indulge in or care for, having the ability to have fish regularly is among the top prosperous blessings our ever so orthodox ancestors can bestow upon us.

While it's easier to chalk it up to caste. The choice and stigma of vegetarianism is more about the region and the kind of people who've rose to power in those regions from ancient times. But most of it lies with people who cling to unfounded beliefs in the name of ""culture"" and not having the sense or ability to question why things are so.

PS: pretty much any class of people have had access to and have consumed some section of non vegetarian food. Just go through the manuscripts from the courts of any kings and such you can get your hands on. Bengali brahmins eats fish. It has nothing to do with caste but everything to do with religion. Naturally some random beliefs might get right. Definitely nothing to do with compassion for animals either. BS ->
>As is common knowledge, 

Common knowledge is WRONG, all the time, not most of the times, all the times. 


>the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet

Wrong again, the mostly part is wrong as well as the entire sentence 



>, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously

Who told you? 



>is much higher than among those who are not from these communities

This proves nothing and helps in NO WAY to make the point you are trying to make. 



> The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians

This proves nothing, and you have no data to proof this, and you have not even defined the higher and lower. Your ranking of higher and lower is based upon an argument you tried to make before, which makes your assertion circular, ergo no signal but noise. 


> burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Who told you?  It is not a burden but a choice. Just because you cannot accept other women's choices does not mean your labelling of their choice as burden is correct. 




>of moral power of minority within Hindus

Wrong again

> be if they feel threatened by the introduction

Circular argument again, it's their choice, and it their right to protest. It is their right to PROTEST AGAINST THE THINGS THEY DO NOT LIKE. just because you do not like their rights and choices does not mean you are correct. Do not poke your nose into other's people choices and rights. 

> In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung

One who eats beef by slaughtering underage calf is NOT the same as one who eats beef of buffallows. 




The above write up a anti semitic and calls for voliance upon bhramins, just like the naxzis do and continue to do so. 




The tax paying citizen [ net + ve tax paying [ no reservation, no govt aided college and medicare ] ] is an asset, not a libilaity. [removed] Ambedkar also wrote about it in one of his books To clarify I am not against vegetarianism itself, it is actually a good thing but it is not good to force it upon poor Indians who have historically suffered great injustices and many still do. If you can afford to chose what you want to eat, that’s great but remember not everyone is able to chose. very true Unfortunately, in Hinduism, certain animals are considered more valuable than certain categories of humans. gohatya or slaughter of cows is a grave sin, perhaps only superseded by brahmahatya  or killing of Brahmins. Why are you replying to your own post.You can edit it. They say that non veg makes your mind dull (which is complete bs btw), to them, I say, Einstein and Newton weren't vegetarians.. I agree with your heading. In India vegetarianism is like that. But you are going too much extreme on other side and getting preachy . Let people eat whatever they want. This post reminds me of the L. K. Advani interview with his wife, where she blurted out that his favourite food was chicken hearing this Advani was visibly perturbed/embarassed and negging her to shut up. > ""People who committed big sins in past life, have been forbidden to enjoy tasty (non-veg) food in this life""

I use this to shut down any vegetarian who pretends to be morally superior as I much on my chicken/fish/beef/pork :) Bang on!

You forgot the main aspect that connects the caste system and diet - untouchability! 

I get people getting nauseated due to the smell. But there's whole different untouchability I have witnessed where the vegetarians don't want people eating non veg on same table to touch their food or even use same spoons. As if some minute particles of non veg are gonna spoil their purity.

And another mistake we do is restricting this discussion to Brahmins. The Jains are vociferously pungent about non vegetarians. Most of the shit non vegetarians receive comes from them! I sometimes wonder how every discussion somehow excludes the nasty practices of that community. I felt very much in two minds when I visited India as a vegetarian (vegetarian for ethical reasons). I was of course absolutely delighted to have so many options when it came to food, and it never felt like the food I had was prepared as an afterthought. In Western countries, you're sometimes lucky if there is one vegetarian option on a restaurant's menu, and that itself will often be ""Please ask your waiter"". This roughly translate as ""Ask us, and we'll go through the back of the fridge and maybe the peels from yesterday, fry up what we find, throw some soy sauce over it and sell it to you as stir-fry for €20"". So having so many choices and such delicious options was a fantastic experience for me.

However, when I chatted with my colleagues while there, I had more than one of them mention to me how some of their family members would use their vegetarianism almost like a weapon. One told me that he and his wife were no longer vegetarian, and consequently her parents had cut contact for years. Even after they had re-established contact, they would not set foot into the non-veg couples house for a long time. They now do come and visit, but the couple have to ""cleanse"" the house before the parents arrive, to make sure that there is no meat in the house at all. Not even powdered chicken stock. And no eggs in the fridge, either.

Another told me that an aunt of hers, when going out with the rest of the family to eat at a restaurant, will bring her own food. And she's only started doing that after not having had a meal with her family for years.

It really made me sad to hear about all this. Sharing food is such an important aspect of companionship, family and culture, and to break that so callously and brutally is beyond my comprehension. I really appreciate this post. It actually came up recently in another thread I was in. I like that you wrote this without criticising any one section. Vegetarianism in India is one of the great plagues forced upon the masses. If we could eat beef and pork and other meat then we would never go hungry. The Chinese eat everything, learn from them. They have survived some of the worst famines in history yet they are thriving PETA, celebrities and Westerners need to stop endorsing vegetarianism (and even worse, veganism) in a developing 3rd world country where most of the people suffer from hunger. It makes me sick when Westerners praise Indians for their non-violent vegetarianism. Sure, Indians can’t hurt cows but they have no issue lynching a human that supposedly ate one Fantastic points put forward. Vegetarianism is form of elitist thinking and lifestyle and it's also repressive. Live and let live, and let people eat what they want ffs. Ugh!
And the virtue signaling in social media.
Every single time when there is a forest fire, this same group couldn't stop posting about meat industry's 3% contribution to global warming.

I'm like.. 
Yeah? The forests stop burning if malnutrition becomes the global standard?

You don't eat meat because of your fucking scriptures you idiot, don't pretend like you care about the planet.

The same people do not care about anything else that is happening in India! [deleted] If you replace that vegetarianism with English language in India and non vegetarianism with the desi languages we will reach the same conclusion , the thing is poor people always follow the rich people not the other way around Root cause is not caste hierarchy. Root cause is some principle behind a caste not wanting to consume meat. It's a stupid argument, comparing caste hierarchy to love for animals. You should rather compare the reason why certain castes want to follow vegetarianism. I wonder when people of kolkata are forced to try Jain/Marwadi Veg food Are you against animal agriculture or for it? I would like to make a new post now because at this point there are too many comments to reply individually so apologies for this. Also thanks for the silver!

Ok so title states that Indian vegetarianism has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals. That does not mean caste system is the reason for vegetarianism. I apologise if at any time I made it appear that way. Religion, region and availability of ingredients as well as economics are also very important factors 

I also apologise for hurting sentiments of anyone, in no way do I mock anyone for holding cow sacred, but the truth is that cows in India are sadly not thriving, most as seen on the road side are actually struggling to survive. We can argue that at least they are free unlike other countries where they are kept in poor welfare farms and abused for meat and dairy etc.

I am not against any community or caste, I am merely against discrimination, a lot of which is so deeply rooted in our society that we have been blinded to a large extent. I believe people should be able to eat what they want

The reason I posted parts of this article from 2017 is because it is still valid and the whole thing has some unnecessary details, otherwise I could have just posted a link to the original. I elaborated my own views and opinion in the comments 

As we can see society is changing and attitudes, not always for the better unfortunately 

Being Vegetarian is good but eating meat is not bad. Yes vegetarianism nowadays will benefit the environment but it not be forced on anyone. The poorest of the poor should have the right a balanced proper diet. They have historically eaten meat so it is unfair to take that away from them as well and advocate them to eat plant based substitutes, so much has already been taken away from them.

Peace and prosperity 

Bharat mata ki jai! Can anyone tell why specifically cow was chosen to be revered and not buffalo? I don't think this is a sound model considering that the fraction of meat eaters don't follow the caste hierarchy, I mean if Caste Hierarchy is Brahmins > Kshatriyas > Vaishyas > Shudras, then going by your explanation the fraction of meat eaters should be in the order of Shudras > Vaishyas > Kshatriyas > Brahmins, but it's more like Shudras > Kshatriyas > Brahmins > Vaishyas. I have seen a lower number of Baniya caste people who are non-vegetarians as compared to Brahmins.

Plus eating meat is more like function of how religious someone is (if meat eating is forbidden in the version of religion in their region), behavioral inertia, and economic situation. Expanding on the last one, Dalits of my village are pretty well to do, I mean you wouldn't notice when you enter lower caste neighborhood, so eating meat for them is not a matter of survival, and behavioral inertia and religious beliefs take over.    

Also I don't think we should be discussing this, because it is implicitly persuading people to eat meat. Currently nearly all meat is industrially produced which results in great suffering for the animals involved, is bad for health and have massive environmental impact. Beef is worst of all, especially the cattle reared solely for slaughter. 

A cow needs to be fed 20+ tons of food and even greater amount of water before it's ready for slaughter in two years, in the meantime it has produced 10s of tons of methane and carbon dioxide. Then you kill it to obtain a few hundred kilograms of meat. This is horrible conversion ratio of resources.  

We have raised cattle for generations, so take it from me that you need at least half acre land to support one cow. Now on one hand you ear mark half acre for two years and then you will get say 300 kg of meat, or you could grow 8 different crops in the meantime which will give you much greater amount of food products, and capture some CO2 in the meantime. I don’t see it as such a problem in Punjab. I suppose it’s because caste hierarchy isn’t as big of an issue as it is in other states. It’s an issue but not as prominent I think. PART 1 \[PART 2 posted as a reply to PART 1\]:

For **TLDR** scroll to the bottom of the comment (PART 2).

\-------

Vegetarianism is the natural course any civilization would follow in a country with the geographical conditions such as India's. And vegetarianism as a cultural phenomenon (religion, caste, etc.) is merely a consequence.

Let me explain this.

We have one of the most fertile plains in the world, created due to the the extensive river network throughout the subcontinent, the most prominent ones being the Indus river plains and the Ganga river plains (630 million acres) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain))

For the climate that early Indians were exposed to, the terrain and the geographical conditions they lived in, agriculture was the most optimal means to feed the society. As a side note, agriculture and relative isolation is the main reason for such explosive population. The conditions were similar for china too. (This research paper illustrates the correlation between agriculture and explosive population growth ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now compare this with China.

China, like India has an extensive river network throughout the early Chinese civilization positioned on the east of Heihe-Tengchong line, where to this day, 94% of the population resides. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong\_Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heihe%E2%80%93Tengchong_Line))

China also has two prominent rivers, namely, Yellow river and the Yangtze river, which led to a network of multiple fertile plains, the most prominent being northeastern Chinese plain. This is also where the earliest Chinese civilization existed ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast\_China\_Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China_Plain)) ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow\_River\_civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River_civilization))

Agriculture, like in India, was naturally adopted in China too, given the climatic, geographical conditions of the country. This again lead to the explosive population growth in China, like in India. ([https://www.nature.com/articles/16339](https://www.nature.com/articles/16339))

Now, let's analyze the vegetarianism aspect of this situation.

Like India, China also had a long history of vegetarianism, mainly due to the agricultural development the civilization witnessed (This later changed, people did eat ""weird $hit""; Mongols have a significant contribution to meat eating culture in China, again, due to Mongolian geography). ([https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html](https://ivu.org/history/east/china.html)) Huan Tsang also notes that Indian upper castes were predominantly vegetarian. ([https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html](https://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Jackson9/chapter03.html))

Comparing this to non-agricultural civilizations (more appropriately, settlements and nomads) found mainly in central, western Asia, Europe and Mid-Africa, where agriculture was difficult, people resorted to meat consumption. The first meat production/culturing (NOT consumption; early Homo sapiens ate meat too but they weren't civilized yet) took place in western Asia, which then spread to central Asia and Europe. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History\_of\_meat\_production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#History_of_meat_production))

Not only India and China, most ancient agricultural civilizations like East (China, Japan), South East, Mediterranean basin adopted vegetarianism. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_vegetarianism#Ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_vegetarianism#Ancient))

\[END OF PART 1. READ PART 2, posted as reply to PART 1\] What a shit ball you are, bringing up caste everywhere I understand where you are coming from but you've given such shitty answers to a lot of comments. Makes me wonder if you are just a hateful person venting on Reddit.
For ex - person asked for stats and you gave an opinion piece and then demanded that the opinion should be taken as facts because it has been said a lot of times by a lot of people. 

And before you claim that I'm upper caste hindutva guy and a bigot (like you've done in this comment section already), I'm neither of those. I’m not attacking any ‘caste community 
There is merely an evil mindset that must be changed for the sake of India. This evil has been going on for far too long and it will one day encompass all of us if it remains unchecked. Case in point, what is happening to our country today Da fuq ? Why is your post word-to-word copy of [this 2017 article](https://scroll.in/article/833178/vegetarianism-in-india-has-more-to-do-with-caste-hierarchy-than-love-for-animals) OP. Care to reply? If you look at the terminology we use

Pure veg 

Non-veg

These are unique to India

Pure veg apparently does not even include onions and garlic and masoor dal as well as mushrooms and more. It is basically the Sattvik diet. It includes yoghurt, milk, ghee, butter. Sometimes vegan tourists mistake pure veg for vegan but that is not the case. Pure veg is for the purest castes

Non-veg is unique to India because vegetarian is not considered the norm in other countries thus the term is not used. ‘Meat’ or protein is used instead Everything I have said is true. People downvoting my comments on this thread are either bigoted/prejudiced or content with ignorance and want to keep the lower castes oppressed [removed] I call this BS.I come from a vegetarian family, been one my whole life. Never witnessed any caste or religion based discrimination. India is too big for such broad generalizations, I can speak for North Indians (Punjabis, including Delhi) are mostly vegetarians and also the most cosmopolitan of Hindus and have the least level of discrimination based on caste, religion or race. I have second hand knowledge for rest of India, still the love, respect and acceptance of animals in India is impressive and admirable.

Whatever the reason may be how Hindus arrived to this but Vegetarianism is the future and the way to go. Vegetarianism and respect for all lives is only increasing in the world, it is actually one of the most important strategies to manage climate change and its impact. I know about 100+ vegetarians, except for the handful religious nutjobs, nobody cares about caste or ""purity"". 

Most vegetarians do not want meat because of the eek factor, the smell or death, the whole idea of boiling dead bodies and eating flesh is insane, disgusting and most importantly extremely disturbing.

Wanna try it out? **Send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045** (over WhatsApp). Please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it too.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Edit 2:
Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

Inspired by [u/onosmosis](https://www.reddit.com/u/onosmosis/)

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen. When the hearing was resumed it was back to them and their lies.

After the public hearing, the council member Sawant [gave an amazing speech supporting the resolution](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=4463) and she was constantly being heckled. And then there was [this](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5106) comment from another council member who could see the bigotry through all the comments made by the bhakts.

In the end, truth prevailed and the council members voted 5 out of 5 in favor of the resolution. 

Right when it was apparent that the resolution was going to be passed, the bhakts started [creating a ruckus](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5574) and after multiple warnings, security was called and they were asked to leave the hall.

Were they chanting NM zindabad as they left the hall? Utterly Despicable. Well done, Seattle Council and well done all those who worked so hard to create and table this resolution.

These sanghi bhakts are the same everywhere innit. Spew lies, shout, disrupt and then blame everyone else apart from themselves. 

Good job for chronicling all this, OP. With bhakts, it's painfully evident that while they feel greatly for the persecuted minorities, their hatred for Muslims is much more in magnitude. A bhakt who is truly for the persecuted Hindu minority would have suggested inclusion of all religions so that relief for persecuted Hindus is expedited in the light of the protests. Of course BJPs doesn't give two shits about the persecuted Hindus. Their endgame is mostly WB polls where they stand to immensely gain if the Muslim illegals are disenfranchised ( who currently are part of the Mamta vote bank) UN should pass a resolution against CAA NRC. Impose sanctions, if required. Whatever it takes  the spirit of India must be saved. Nice to see the council focused on the real issues of the city. Always wondered why shit never got done in Seattle... thanks. Hasn't US, France and Israel supported CAA or my Facebook feed is broken? Again this only highlights biggest red flag with Muslims (there I said it, bury me) that religion > nation. Why are they talking about India in Seattle. They are just hacking the democratic processes and have misplaced loyalties. I want to see one passed against China. Bunch of hypocrites. It's like saying 'happy mahoram' to a Muslim. It is insulting, unrelated (how can mahoram be happy?) And does not make sense. Seattle isn't even in India. Not saying CAA is right or wrong."

Why do we do that! Why do we try to see the difference in one other.

Why is there even an idea of someone being superior by their birth.

How can someone think they have more rights than others.

Animals are better than this. Government must compensate the family, the best it can. Life lost. Casteism at its ugliest. This country will not Change in a million years. I don't even duckin care anymore. Bloody hell. Casteism is one of the very important reasons why India is so low in HDI and various other indexes. This is why we need **caste based** reservations This is so fucked up and the bad part is this is very near to my village (about 30Km) in Punjab.And I don't think this is casteism . It's a pretty peaceful and safe area. RIP. I tweeted few days back saying how dalits and other minorities facing discrimination and this ""girl"" commented dalits are not minorities and she is a dalit and i am fucking stupid because dalits are hindu and they are safe. This is fucking digusting, whoever did this should be sent to jail. The deceased was jat Sikh too right ?

So I’m confused - I thought there’s no casteism among the Sikhs Pains me ! Why oh why be so bloody stupid. Casteism  is getting more and more deep rooted in society instead of fading with the progress of education ,job options ,other digital information sources .There is an increase of tensions between different castes even on slightest poking by any  miscreants ,Lots of abusing you tube comments ,videos,Facebook status ,Whatsapp forward will instantly start to make things more worst.Only God knows when we will be out of this shit of killing each other based upon caste hierarchy and rank .

No body have right to kill anyone when we as a human do not have power to make alive anyone. Yet, the UC in this country have the audacity to question reservations. WTF? Feudalism is still alive and thriving in India. In another world this guy would've been a supermodel or something. Such is the lottery of birth sadly :(. WTF is wrong with people in Punjab! Modi doesnt care. This is messed up Godse did not assassinate Gandhi, it was an accident, I’m told. People believe what they want to. 
But you have a point, and the prosecution will have to prove the casteism allegation. Regardless, it is a heinous crime and must be punished severely. I do feel sad
But was it necessary to mention that he was a dalit?
I mean it wouldn't make things better

So it is clear that we have legislators who are working lesser and lesser as the decades pass, both in planning and in implementation. 

The implementation reduction means that MPs aren't attending and the planning reduction means they have institutionalised working less.

It looks as if that is a very bad thing - they are not doing their work.

Which is partly true.

But I think that their job is to make laws and the lesser they work, the lesser new laws they make, the better it is.

Ideally, they should remove bad laws, and old outdated laws, debate more and amend more laws to make them more relevant, especially updating fines. 

OP, you could post this to r/dataisbeautiful as Original Content [OC] but I think you need to label the X and Y axes clearly and add the years of the constitution of the Lok Sabhas near their numbers. Optionally also add the ruling coalition / party name to give more context.

(obvious /s)  Another line with the ratio (actual / scheduled) would be interesting. good one, OP.  

also, despite this falling days, they keep giving themselves multi-fold salary hikes every year or so.  
plus , the number of days there's utter chaos in the LS  .  Paying them by attendance will solve it."

Politics,Pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid.,194,futac9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/futac9/pitting_a_community_against_a_political_party_is/,73,1586033908.0,"First of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently. 

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

If you have any objections to what i have said, i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness, use your brains i don't care what your parents, uncle aunties believe in, use your own brains otherwise India is not gonna stay a democratic country, and this is not even a baseless fact anymore, it's all around us, we just close our eyes to look around.",chillinvillain122," Our country is just too far in at the moment and there's no turning back now, our best hope is to believe that we make it to the other side without taking too much damage.

Something much worse than the 2002 riots is ahead of us, it always was but now with the Covid-19 situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner. A couple of points

1. I think India is inherently fragile. BJP has not invented something, they are just leveraging the pre existing fault lines. Another thing is that there are so many people who vote for BJP because they are so fed up with the opposition. 

I don’t know exactly but Rahul Gandhi wouldn’t get a lot of crowd in my tiny village. 

2. A substantial part of this country do not care about democracy. People don’t like having to make difficult decisions.

Don’t consider this as a debate to your points, just my PoV. BJP stands for divisive politics. In a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics. A place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card. BJP is being run like an efficient political business so i don't see when and how it can be stopped. If you kill in the name of religion, your God has already forsaken you.           
- Unknown Though I appreciate what you are saying, Majority of the people are just too naive and uneducated to understand what you are saying.
Lack of Education and awareness is the root cause of divisive politics based off of religion. Your actions show your real motives, not your words. going by your logic, there is no real reason Muslim women should vote for congress as they were the ones opposing triple talaq and it was bjp who made it into law In the US, you say ""Chinese Virus"" and people will call your a racist. 

In India, you say ""Corona Jihad"" you're a nationalist. 

And people say India will soon become a superpower. My ass. If you pay attention, India is becoming the next Pakistan. The only Job of a political party is to stay in power no matter what they have to do for it.
I don't think BJP is at fault, the people of India are at fault. Fuck BJP. Fuck Religious people. Dalits dream of becoming a mainstream Hindu someday where they are treated equally, so they will do what they are told. They forget that they will never be accepted as equal. They are in for a rude awakening >  and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes

Because they don't understand how Hinduism promotes Brahminical supremacism, which implies oppression of people like them. That's why they are, and their ancestors before them were, and their descendants will be, dalits!

You can't expect everyone to be as woke as Ambedkar who understood how Hinduism is oppressive to Hindu lower castes. The same people conveniently ignore the numerous Hindu Festivals The reason dalits support bjp is because the rss recruit them at a very young age. Rss targets the vulnerable as in the poor. The poor mostly consists of sc/st. And as such the rss sink their claws into them at a very young age. They're brainwashed by the age they can make decisions on their own they are set in their own ways. This isn't the case for all sc/st some do luckily get away.

Remember China created new production lines for wuhan, and most of China is coming out of total quarantine while we are going into one. 5 baje thaliyan bajao I don't understand the people of this country at all. They're the same ones that beat the shit out of doctors when something happens because of a lack of supplies. While also using them as scapegoats for thali bhajao bla bla. It's the same with the army. Use them whenever you want to further some sympathy argument but treat them like shit. Wait, so was the complaint legitimate or not? The article isn't clear on this. According to other tweets, the first doctor apparently posted some sort of retraction as well to her claim. Was this under coercion or a misunderstanding from her?

Alt News should probably do an investigation on this topic, as their fact-checking seems to be more rigorous. everyone is silenced.... only JenocideJumlaman speaks. Chutiyon ki kami nahi We respect doctors by endangering their lives.Government should provide ample PPEs to doctors and people should understand that these people are not just endangering their own lives by fighting this epidemic, but their loved ones too and still they are choosing to fight.

Imagine if we send our soldiers in a war without armor or weapons, will we win the war or lose it.This is the same situation that we are in right now.Doctors neither have the weapon or the armor to wage this war for long and this is going to be a long drawn fight.
Also, doctors would be jailed and their license revoked if they refuse to work under these unsafe conditions. We do not need to piss off our medical health services personnel - that should be the rule in best of times, but more so in current circumstances. We are cheap knockoff of China now I would say so what , Doctors go thorugh quite a ragging still . Have the thick skin , thse chutiya social media trolls won't save your life infact it's the other way round. 

Ideally all students/Docs across state should request the CM to procure it . This is the time Or maybe they were spreading fake news and on being called out, they deleted their accounts.

Politics,A new political party gave a full front page ad in a popular newspaper today in Bihar,729,ff8sth,https://i.redd.it/yjo9wpy38el41.jpg,146,1583678171.0,,aaluinsonaout," This looks like an IIPM ad 1. Where did they get funds for such full page ads? 
2. What is the use of English ads in such demographic (Not implying that Biharis cannot read English, but for masses Hindi would have been much better) A party with the name 'plurals' claiming to be progressive with a symbol of a ~~unicorn~~  pegasus In BIHAR. It ticks all the boxes for a ridiculous defeat. [deleted] Looks like some scientology type shit Lol. This is hilarious. Being a Bihari, I totally appreciate the humour in this. Plulols! Political party Kam koi obnoxious cult jaisa LG rhi hai Kaun jaat ki hai ye?

*Baaki sab dhua hai dhua* What a fucking joke. That's not how elections are won. Look at kanhaiya kumar that guy is continuously addressing the masses. Been in top 20 most influencal men on Times. The crowd gathered is humongous and he's not even a mla. That's how you win an election. First of all no use of ad in English in bihar. Even people who know English won't see you as an alpha male/female if you act all high and mighty in such demographic. Bhihar needs someone who can bow down rub dirt on his cut and carry on. Not I join you or I fight along with you. 

But 

You join me  in my fight ... cool.

Looks like 

One more rich kid on the block with illusions of bringing change with top to bottom approach. 

I dont have much info on her. Please correct me if im wrong. CV mein badiya lagega yeh. Looks like a well funded research project. felt cute, opened a party, might get few urban votes later Prashant Kishore planning to release independent parties just like this in every state https://www.pushpampc.com/home.aspx

Alright, which one of you is Pushpam? Chaudary ki chori chunav lad rahi hai. Kuch angrezi ka naam hai party ka. Udne wale ghode ka button daba dena bus. There is a website, smartphone app, big mission statements and demands for donations.

And yet, just lists current problems & their (her) plan to 'challenge' the system.
That's it. No real plan of action or agenda for change.

Just another fresh political science graduate with freshly read ideas from a Karl Marx book. Props to the guy who came up with the Unicorn/Pegasus thing. A little humour in politics is always appreciated. People who are mocking her, should not forget who our PM is and how he became PM. A whole lot of educated mass became ""zombie bhakt""

This party needed attention and look like she is getting a lot of attention with this advertisement. 1) people are shitting on this add by saying that they'll never win. Why ? This is a democracy, people complain about dynasty politics but when people try to break there's hue and cry. 

2) people are not really talking about this persons qualifications or the qualifications of the members of the party ? Are they the iipm of politics or do they really mean it ? What are their promises in the manifesto ? Red & Black. Nice Wow......
That's a new take for any political party......
Won't succeed though unless they reach the ground massess......
Otherwise it is absolutely nothing...... Is this anime party with that unicorn? This is cringy as fuck and the party sounds like a fucking cult More power to her!!! Lol... Looks like it is just her from reading the website.  Where do they get the funding for this? There was a Mahila Empowerment Party that sprung up during the Karnataka election also. 'Plurals' is kinda tongue twister word. Slightly difficult to pronounce for even folks who are comfortable with English. Baqi logon ki baat door ki hai. optimism? The symbol of the party looks like a freaking Wine Company's symbol lmao... This is what happens when you watch a few seasons of House of Cards and decide to start your own political party. ..and she even declared herself a CM candidate already lol r/im14andthisisdeep r/iamabadass r/madlads Strong Mahila empowerment party vibes Woah! Everything about this is weird as fuck. Plus that stare screams evil and makes me uncomfortable. I like their Hindi font. Did some digging, its apparently [Poppings](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/fonts/poppins) Chutiya Samaj party would still be a better political party name then plurals Sasti Bloomberg Ad looks too progressive for Bihar demographic.

Not insulting Biharis can't be progressive, just saying about general demographic Looks like am low budget TV series poster.

Also the name is dumb. You want to win in India's most backward state with Plurals as party name? Seriously? Okay you got our attention...can we have her for AMA ? Is the party symbol unicorn? LMAO! Wtf....Bihar is one of the top illiterate states aur inki audicity ki CM candidate bhi declare kr Diya.
Bhala kisko samajh aayega There's one main issue with this ad. If you Google plurals you don't get anything about this party . As a digital marketer I'm baffled by their strategy of choosing such a poor name for the party On women's day.. Very apt This rooks like a ""The Room"" remake with female lead instead of Tommy Wissieu I rather place my bet on seeing pig with wings. I'm skeptical of any political party and corporation. Don't think this party has any chance of winning anything in Bihar. Doesn't ring any bells with the voters. Though I appreciate the effort.

Visited the place recently. It's literally like traveling back in time. The people are conservative af. Women are expected to behave in a certain manner, do everything for all the members of the family, eat last and what not.

And as far as the political part goes, I got the feel that it's more about the change in the attitude of the people than just the ruling party. The places are super duper polluted. Like the whole city was a dumpyard. Litter everywhere. Dusty air. No wonder two of the major cities of Bihar featured in the top 15 most polluted cities of the world. 
The roads were bad, yes but there was literally no road sense. People drove on both sides of road, no regard for any traffic rules. And the honking was directly proportional to the acceleration. Literally blow your brains out noise on the road. Yeah... no... ""Plurals"" won't resonate with the masses in *any* state. If you have waste time explaining what your party's name even means... then you've lost half the campaign battle already. Shieeeet. Saw this in the morning but didn’t care to read anything and flipped the page thinking it’s a soap opera/news channel ad. (Not that they are different ) Why does this looks like a cult? This is weird. She's a London based daughter of Binod Chaudhary, a JDU leader. 

Answers a lot of questions regarding funding. This is basically like what OnePlus is to Vivo/Oppo. Looks Promising... She is JD(U) leader Vinod Chaudhary's daughter. No wonder why she came into politics. 

Link: https://shrts.in/bJV9 Saw her educational qualification, atleast she has credibility to become a CM unlike the remaining bozos. Even though i know her laptop promise is 100% fake, i would still vote for her. The chances of her making rash and stupid decisions are really less compared to the other bozos. Also, the chances of her making calculated and logical decisions for the benefit of people is really high. Hope she improves her marketing though. No offense but she looks like a snake,that smile atleast! Eeeeee plurarls kaa hota hai ??? Is it April 1st already? This colour scheme is not working. She looks she's back after having sold her soul to the devil. Yeah right, you are going to win Bihar with a english language ad.


1st step to form a political party in Bihar is to pick a caste (or few aligned castes)

2nd step, is to rope in some bahubalis.

3rd step, is to use whatever leverage your party gets, to make money. C'mon Bihar give us the experience of being a Super Power's Neighbour . From Nepal . I'll let her deal with my snake. Pehle caste bataiye
Phir ideology bataiye
Phir ye bataiye ki opening propaganda kya hoga

Aap chronology ko samajhiye In Russia Putin pays for certain opposition campaigns to run .  Gives him opportunity to claim they are all sorts of things.  Will have to see how this plays out but looks like her Jdu votebabk isn’t very important for all parties Plurals HAVE arrived. Sounds as apolitical and sanghi as AAP."

A bunch of us (various nationalities) were sitting around discussing the news, and one of my fellow indian girls was telling us about a video she saw. A young Pakistani student in China had posted it saying that air India had evacuated the Indian students in his Chinese university and that no one was coming for him. 

There was apparently an overwhelming amount of support from fellow students asking air India to evacuate all students irrespective of race. 

I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. And the girl said ""Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out."" 
I have never felt more shocked. 

Irrespective of historical politics between our nations, hoping for an entire country to die out is horrible. This is a global pandemic and the best time to set aside all our biases and support everyone. Everyone has loved ones who we're worried about. We are all susceptible to the virus just as much as every other race. 

Let's put aside religion and take care of each other.

I'm probably going to get some hateful comments about this post anyway. But I don't care. This is me imploring that we all stand together (at a social distance, no touchy) and try to keep ourselves and our neighbors safe. Thanks for coming to my TED talk",ThatRedScooter," What an incredibly narrow minded person. Our great grandfathers were from the same nation. People in Pakistan are humans too.

She said this in front of people from other nations too ? She is living abroad, did she never shop in a Pakistani shop (half the so called ""Indian shops"" are run by Pakistanis, at least here in Europe) or interact with Pakistanis abroad?

I would understand if someone within India says that, because lets face it, with the current political atmosphere in India, that would not be surprising at all. But living abroad and saying shit like this is... she is a horrible person. [deleted] [Here ya go, another thread. It is a lost cause.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/flmmps/man_riding_motorcycle_beaten_up_in_maharashtras/) I am in two minds about this.

I do feel that we shouldn't in general dehumanize people. It *seems* grossly unfair. The wars and games between our ruling classes shouldn't destroy our humanity as individuals.

But there's also this angle: the members of a tribe (religion, nation, race, caste, ethnicity, etc.) need to be aware that the tribe's harmful actions towards others will exact a toll on them individually. For instance, if members of caste A are especially casteist and/or communal, then individuals from that group should feel the heat for it from others, even if the individual himself or herself may not be casteist or communal. Otherwise they will have that much less incentive ""fix"" their tribespeople.

I have used this principle with respect to myself. If I am hated because members of my ""tribe"" exhibit certain undesirable behaviors, then while I may not ""deserve"" it, I certainly should realize that the reaction is expected, natural, and even healthy, in a way. It gives me an incentive to fix the harmful actions of my fellow tribespeople. Hating or punishing the members for the transgressions of their tribe is a normal strategy used in tribal calculus. It may not be healthy individually or collectively to suppress this ancient instinct. Just like our instincts for revenge and sexual jealousy, it might exist for a reason. r/ABCDesis If the government allow us :). > and that no one was coming for him.

ha he'd most likely be better off staying in China Is that what they call trying Humanism? Brother you are preaching to the wrong crowd. You need to post this to other hateful subs. >	I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. 

The problem with these things is that they're usually expected to only go one way. It's only Indians who are expected to bend over backwards and consider humanity and finer human values, Pakistanis are never expected to return the gesture. 

Support for fellow men would also require the Pakistanis to stop sponsoring the terrorists who kill Indian civilians. At this point terrorists have killed more Indians than covid-19 has (though I expect that equation may change in a few weeks) and yet Pakistan continues to actively support terrorists.

Things have gotten to a point where despite being on the FATF grey list, which hurts their economy, they continue to support it. They're willing to let their country burn if it means Indians will die. When you have that kind of hatred emanating from that side, you can expect it to be reciprocated.

FWIW, I'd prefer for India to evacuate all students as long as the logistics allow it. What do we do after that though is an open question. Will Pakistan take back these students or simply dump them on India to treat/quarantine? Remember this is a nation that refused to accept the bodies of its own army men during Kargil, and the army is basically the organization that runs the country. It's still morally the better option and so we should have done it, but let's not bring in all these ideas of support for fellow men which only ever go one way. Nice virtue signaling Wrong sub my man. I mean there is always this one dickwad in convos like these. > Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus.

Politics,AAP’s woeful response to the Delhi communal violence reflects the limit of its welfare politics,214,fd7q3z,https://scroll.in/article/954991/aaps-woeful-response-to-the-delhi-communal-violence-reflects-the-limit-of-its-welfare-politics,45,1583325384.0,,Dumma1729," So the argument is that the DMs could have commanded the police or the armed forces but didn't. The DMs didn't do that or that's what's being said. Also, there was no formal request from AAP. 

What does AAP have to say about it? I'm sure someone would have asked it of them. That's not it. What he did was deliberate. His silence on genocide and granting permission to police against Kanhayia.

He was expected to be on ground to protest against the genocide, he didn't even held a press conference against it.

This all was a message to gain more votes, he want's to expand and don't want to lose any votes he can score on, even if people who support bhagwa terrorism. He made it clear that he is not against muslim genocide so that he can be more popular.

He is a **snake**

His primary motive is his political carrier, not what he projects, the idea of being anti-corruption and righteous. 

If not criticized he had no problem playing the caste politics, *mai baniya hu mujhe vote do*. His rajya sabha nomination are also shady It was pretty clear he sold RS seat for money like BSP does , Also they both share same caste as Kejriwal.

[OPINION | Arvind Kejriwal Sold Rajya Sabha Seats for Money: Mayank Gandhi](https://www.news18.com/news/opinion/opinion-arvind-kejriwal-sold-rajya-sabha-seats-for-money-mayank-gandhi-1621639.html)

And above all we should not forget why people left AAP on first place : There is no AAP it's AK, the party itself is pretty anti-democratic,  Arvind Kejriwal does not allow anyone to come forward other than him, their is no ideology just AK himself.

But my problem is something bigger than that, my problem is the fact that indians no matter their political inclination they all tend to be **Bhakts** Just like sanghies blindly support Narendra/BJP we have their counter part here too who are blind bhakts of AK. We should be neutral and chose whatever is best, even if you vote for them you should not become bhakt for them. 

Throughout the history of india indians have done this and it always result into disaster, we should follow our own moral compass not our *führer.* At the end of the day, their priority is keeping the power and money. Everything else is secondary or for the show. >""woeful response to the Delhi communal violence reflects the limit of its welfare politics""

The reason ""communal violence"" is propagated on the population by a political party is primary due to lack of proper education.....AAP is focusing on providing proper education. 

The only thing AAP could of had done differently was AAP MLA's going to the streets and sitting right in the middle of the road where the riots was happening. 

And you know what would of had happened to them if they did that; they would of been killed on the spot. The reason for this is that the riots were started by men brought in from UP. BJP learned from the Gujarat riots not to use locals. 

They would of been killed the same way Congress EX MP Ehsan Jafri was murdered in 2002 Gujarat riots 

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/The-five-men-who-killed-Ehsan-Jafri/article14427953.ece

*The five accused who have been convicted for lynching the former MP are Yogendrasinh Shekhawat, Jayesh Jingar, Krishnakumar, Jayesh Parmar and Naran Tank. All of them were sentenced to life impriosnment for 14 years.* True, AK didn't show courage during the riots, but I don't think he could have controlled them without the police. The most he could have done is some noise. AAP has 62 MLAs.
We know the police are not under their control, but all of those 62 have got at least 10 security guards.
If they all would have gone together with their protection force on the day of events, at least those 620 would have protected few lives. Assuming the police guards feel ashamed in front of the minister to act.

But all of those 62 chose to sit and enjoy Twitter. Mob of both the sides was out their in numbers..its was communal frenzy. What can AAP will do. If riots continued for 3 days in a national capital means police stand downed. Lets be honest kapil mishra is not a big leader to go this far unless he had the blessings of amit shah. More and more anti CAA protests are taking place and riots is to instill fear in em that's why all that happened and police dont have the orders to stop it What has happened is that BJP, by crying about identity politics the loudest, has made sure all other parties are now shy to be seen as engaging in identity politics. In this way they have made sure that all parties have ceded ground to them and they can now play identity politics themselves to their heart's content. If a party can win 54% of the votes in a city, it has the political capital to intervene. Who knows, maybe a big supporter backed intervention and a ""call for peace"" movement could have become a launchpad for kejri on the national scene again. One possibility is that AAP was not prepared how to handle this. They have learnt to suppress their natural instincts and now they do things while keeping the brand imagery in mind. Due to that, they couldn't decide in time on what their next step should be branding wise and by then the ship had already sailed. [deleted]"

After the first Delhi shootings, Arnab Goswami and Republic TV were trying to spin it as the act of a simple, 'provoked' Indian with the hashtag #StopProvokingIndia. If a peaceful protest is apparently deserving of a violent response, then why bother with politeness? Call a spade a spade and a fascist a fascist. Where would you draw the line? Completely agree with her. The rules of the game have changed. As long as we are NOT provoking or encouraging violence, these tactics are fine to counter hate mongers like Arnab and others. cue the RW now bemoaning ""hawwww Liberal Bollywoodiya bAdDd!!!""

edit: the responses on the ""other discussions"" sub are pure gold, as expected. I agree. In a state where situation is so bad that 'journalists' berate the people of an entire state for making their choice (which he doesn't agree with) in an election, on national TV, politeness has no role to play.

Being ""impolite"" to BJP supporters isn't going to change their minds. It will infact further polarize them to the right.

We are supposed to come up with a strong national level alternative to BJP/Modi, simply abusing them and their supporters isn't going to cut it. we need to be careful in speaking about politics in our country. Why do I feel like these people are playing straight into the BJP's hands and dividing people further. We need better people representing leftist ideologies.

Edit: sorry I meant liberal ideologies. Not leftist. Just imagine a Muslim person saying this and adding allah ho akbar to it lol Well said. Every individual with conscience should speak up. Enough of hatred spread. Agreed I don't agree with this, if you talk about Gandhi on one side and do this on another.

The fundamental problem is that they are always enraged and never patient or calm. I pity on you, I really do. Rightists are no gods. They are idiots too. Downvote, report, do whatever the hell you want. This left vs right drama needs to stop. This has come down to people's ego now. While the poor in the interiors of the country suffer, these protests do no good to them. Be it Modi, Shah, Kamra or Swara, everyone just needs to shut up now. Why she a thing on Reddit?

I want to improvise that if you think there will be tangible benefits to it, only then do it, otherwise don't let her cause ideological divides within your family.

Also, hate the way she's shaking her head, my intuition is that she is trying to cash in on the heated sentiments she is rousing and this is not something heartfelt. Swara is a fame craving bitch irrespective to whichever side you lean to."

If you did something bad you were chastised and made to resign from your post in fear of the public but these days, even if you openly call for discrimination and violence of a community you will not only be rewarded with a Y-level security but also the public approval. 

Hindutva/ communal polarization is one helluva drug. To be honest, while Nehru was open to criticism, and he supported Shanker over his cartoons, it was Indira's Emergency that shut down Shanker's Weekly. 

I saw the final issue of the magazine and they had a fun cartoon showing Nehru and Indira with the subtle inclination of start and end Your question assumes that these cartoonists worked under similar political and social conditions as today. Because 40 years ago, such a question wouldn’t even come up. It just didn’t occur to us then. Discounting the brief period of the Emergency, society and the political discourse was far freer and a lot more tolerant. The political class had a sense of humour, and even laughed at themselves now and then at cartoons that lampooned them. 

Times have changed, my friend. Regardless of whether some may feel insulted, it’s the sad truth that society and the political class today are a LOT more intolerant.

I don't doubt they will get votes. Indian voters are getting tired of BJP too. But we don't have a real alternative. Congress is spineless, the same MPs that were in Congress jumped ship to BJP when given the chance, and they will come back to Congress if BJP doesn't do good. He is not very mature and has made a lot of mistakes and unnecessary enemies along the way and hence losing credibility. 

However, he has shown an impressive amount of learning and improvement. It will take time for him to build credibility at national level and hopefully he gets better with time. I dont live in Delhi but hear from my friends stories of good governance by him. As for freebies, socialist programs from a surplus government don't hurt anyone and are good for everyone in long run. Telling from personal experience. /r/enlightenedcentrism, but unironically. AAP is the same, Kejriwal has grown

He isn't the same idiot who complained 24 hrs about BJP and Modi

That's what they should do. Keep up the good work and not fall in the traps of Hindutva. I am sure AAP will and should return to run Delhi going forward. I honestly have faced no difference but whenever I interact with maids, security guards, Uber drivers, etc., it feels like their welfare schemes have genuinely helped them. I don't think I am in any position to criticise any of them.

AAP has surely improved the quality of education in Government schools bringing in better infrastructure, more engaging parent interactions, etc.

They should not align with INC, BJP, BSP, SP, etc., because all these parties have had a history, at some point or the other, of corruption. It will take years for AAP to gain the footing of even SP or BSP but I don't see that as a bad thing. And support the abrogation of Article-370 and abolishing the statehood of Kashmir while demanding the same for Delhi. Nice touch AAP please bring French secularism to India. i love kejriwal ❤️ I don't think Kejriwal's ideology is issue for any voter. It will take some skills and a control on ego to spread beyond Delhi. Till now AAP hasn't managed to build presence in any other metro which would happily accept his brand of politics. They are literally just Congress that can implement schemes.

They pander to the times with no real ideology. It works as long as you keep delivering.

They are center right not center He is a populist. Today i'll take him over anyone in the country because he is way better than others however i don't think his policies of distributing freebies will work in long term. This is perfect centrism- enabling fascism. 🔔

He is as opportunistic as one politician can get, its just he is going one extra mile on development that's why he bit bearable!


>Whether it was supporting Balakot air strikes and Article 370 move in Kashmir, staying away from JNU and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests at Shaheen Bagh, or chiding Pakistan for interfering in the Delhi election – Arvind Kejriwal is cautiously redrawing and refuelling the centre in Indian politics.

He asked for proof on Balakot air strike. He stayed away from JNU & CAA protests cause Delhi elections were near and he didn't wanted any controversy. He is still 'anti-national' liberal and opportunistic politician. Indian Bernie Sanders."

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",keylimepie1123," ""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phrase Feel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended. 

Hope this helps! Tell them you are allergic to  carbs and vegetable oil. 

big chunk of options  will be taken off the shelf . One trick that works for me is: say you are full well before you are. They will push to eat some more, refuse it a couple of times and then have it :) Things not to do in life:

>Visit India when you are recovering from an eating disorder.

None of the advice people giving you on this sub will work when you are gonna see so much Delicious stuff and you would want to try each and every one of those. 

> How can I politely refuse food if I am full? 

You start saying ""I'm full"" when you have eaten 50% of what you want to eat! Just say ""Ewww"" at hit the hand holding the plate. ^/s Just say that you are stuffed and mentioned that you loved it. Usually works. I don’t smoke so whenever somebody offers or forces me a cigarette, I say “I just had one before coming here” haha Simple and short. Stay drama free. Put your foot down and say ""No, THANK YOU!""

Stay drama free and simple. Repeat
Say ""No, Thank You"" Arre nahi aunty pet bhar gaya aur nahi kha sakhti 

Sach main aunty pet full ho gaya. 


Isse teen chaar bar bol dijye. Tell them you or on a fast. Simple as that  just ask for a glass of water when they offer food

First of all, an Indian with half a brain would not utter pro Pakistan slogans on a stage. Whatever she was trying  to say there was an obvious miscommunication from her side. Didn't Owaisi and co stop her too in the stage. Why glorify that What is ""AADAB""? Tbh, she shouldn’t have uttered Pakistan word. It always leads to messy consequences, rightly so or otherwise IMO the people who actually make statements like ""Jinnah Waali Aazadi"" or ""Alag desh"" or ""Tukde-tukde"" should be the ones prosecuted first. Such statements deeply malign all the struggle and hardships our freedom fighters had to endure. The very same struggle, which has now, near 74-years later, enabled us to live on with our lives with much more independence and freedom than available back during the days of war.

As for ""Pakistan Zindabaad"", I'd say it's a dumb and a pointless statement to say the least. Dare I say it, in almost every aspect; geopolitical, social, economical- we've excelled over them. So there's no point in spreading half-truths like these. We should first concern ourselves over the issues plaguing *our* society, and later fret about how better/ worse we are compared to other states.

And no, such people shouldn't certainly be jailed- can't comment about sedition charges, but whenever we've to talk about development or progress as such, we give comparisons to first world countries. Does that insinuate us becoming ""pro-first"" world-ism? Why doesn't anybody say, ""Go to Sweeden"" or similar things then?

This entire narrative of Nationalist/ Urban Naxal being manipulated is rendering immense harm to our country, Let supreme, high and session courts shut themselves down and tadipar gang start khap panchayet in every block. Why waste tax payer's money on sinking titanic.

Only good nazi is a dead nazi Anti-national spotted. Next target of attack - Mahindra showrooms. This chaatu was sucking up to BJP during the tax cuts

Convenient activism It amazes me that no one is even willing to entertain the idea that these goons were actually sent by the Congress/opposition. Given the corruption and lack of morals on both sides of the aisle, this needs to at least be considered as an explanation for who these goons were. What does the government in power have to gain by doing this? They already have the police to do their dirty work for them. 

Obviously this being an echo chamber I’ll be downvoted to oblivion for being a “Bhakt” but the reality is that if you want to be objective you have to consider the possibility. Go ahead, downvote me :) It was the Left that carried out these attacks. I'm convinced of it. It's not going to be long before motaman pulls the mask from their faces and humiliates the entire national Left and the anti-CAA movement in one masterstroke.

Rahul is a nice man. a good human being. may not be the best politician but doesnt need to be. his good character is enough. thanks rahul this guy is genuinely a nice person , her brother as is mentioned in the article is a pilot now cause of him , he paid for everything and asked them never to reveal it , Modi would have milked it dry , that is the difference between the two. [deleted] He regularly talked to her brother and encouraged him to pursue his dream career in air force Modiji bina diye hi chilla chilla ke bolte hai😜, like a pornstar fake scream Good person. If congress want to come back to power. They have to let go of the family thinking and choose a strong leader and a great speaker. Apparently people in India do not go after education and qualifications in a leader. Majority just want a leader who can give long buttery and dreams speeches. Nice :) Frankly speaking, we never gave Rahul Gandhi a chance. We always ridiculed him because of his errors while speaking. And soon, everybody started thinking of him as a joke. I'm not saying he would have been a good or a bad leader, but we never even saw him as one. I cam to this realisation a while ago of how many people don't clear their interviews because of their  communication skills. Same thing happened with this guy, but at a massive level. The smooth talker got the job, but doesn't know what to do XD

PS: Not a congress supporter, just my observation. To survive in politics one need to be ruthless. Rahul is lacking that. That is a flaw with the existing political set up. But unfortunately political commentators are considering that as a negative trait. Because most of them expect a leader to be a dictatorial monarch.

I oppose Congress's policies. Not a big fan of Rahul. But somehow I have a soft corner for him and believe that he is a honest person. What a good man.. might not be a good politician, but definitely a good man India doesn't deserve a Prime Minister like Rahul.

India deserves Modi.

We have so badly ruined our politics that it seems 'unnatural' to us when a politician shows decency and kindness. Everyone here is like 'He is too good of a human being to be a good politician'. 

Take a moment to see just how messed up that is. RG lost his closest family members at a young age. He never tried to gain emotional sympathy or attention out of it. Unlike Modi who still gets attention and sympathy out of having been a tea maker in the past. It's not surprising to me that he did this kind act. I'm gonna be the 'that guy' here. Here's a quote from the movie- Parasite:

""They are so rich yet they are so nice.
They are nice because they are rich."" Quite happy to see this forum is genuine and not filled with BJP IT cell. (Like TOI comments section) He is agood man but incompetent politician and administrator. Cause that's what heroes do. I came across this somewhere a few months ago. I think that he also helped Nirbhaya's brother to become a pilot. Rahul is a really great guy, I liked him since a long time. One should also check out Gaurav Gogoi, a great rising young politician. Nobody would say such a thing about modi, not even his mother. Says about the character of a man....i have always believed him to be a nice person and preferred him over the two goons we got....my friends say that he is stupid but i reply that ""i would rather take a stupid man over murderous lunatics not that he is stupid"" Bhakt nahi maanenge Good people aren't really cut out for politics...agar modi ji hotay to roz ek tweet kartay family kay saath What's wrong with this dude?like I don't see a flaw on this guy Empathy isn't dead Cant believe the people of India chose a rioter,chaiwala,unsecular leader instead of this guy Check out the articles comment section! Politics need to change from when politicians say who is the worst party, don't vote for them to look at the improvements we have done and vote for us. And frankly at some places i I can see it changing. There is progress. It's slow but it's there. Read comments under the news source. Rahul, you are a good man. Thank you. Dayum BJP wasted their 4 fully qualified future election candidates and he thanks Rahul. I usually don't participate in political slugfests (!) but I wonder what his constituents have to say about that?

Especially victim's families who have had no communication with their decades-old MP! 

Again, nothing to take away from the ""humanitarian"" aspect of it, if at all it can be called that! *everyone liked that.* I'm not pro congress, that's what I think at least. but since so many of you say he's nice but not a good politician. why? what doesn't make him a good politician?  his inability to argue? are his plans bad? I'm just asking out of curiosity :) His character was assassinated by BJP. I was their strategy to gain popularity. Just like they did with Nehru, calling such a great man a “womaniser” and what not. Everyone saying he is not a good politician haven't seen RG transform from his younger days in politics when he used to make blunders in speaking. His 2014 campaign was absolute trash and this is the image of RG that most here have held on to. 

In the run up to 2019-LokSabha, RG went on a world tour, met and talked with people around the world, and established himself worldwide to an extent as India's potential PM. He also helped INC win 5 states (I know what happened in KA and what's happening in MP, but hey atleast they won then.) , 4 of them in the BJP's hindi heartland. 

Then he went around many universities and had open question-answer sessions with students where he brilliantly and confidently answered all of their questions. On the congress youtube channel, they had two episodes of 'Apni Baath Rahul Ke Saath' in which RG talked to youth in one episode and some people of the working class in another.

Come the Lok Sabha campaign. INC releases their manifesto which listed their promises in a great way and RG promised to carry out all of these. RG started campaigning in the south where his rallies were longer due to the translation required. Then he went on north where in every rally he would have approximately 20 minute speeches mainly speaking about unemployment, demonitization, and his NYAY. (Here is where he could have done it a little more aggressively as the fiercest statement would be Chowkidaar chor hai, never more than that.)

And lets not forget, he had several interviews with various tv channels, and he occasionally vlogged on his youtube channel. He also held regular press conferences. On the other hand, Narendra didn't have a single unscripted interview whilst also refraining from saying even a word in his press conference.

TL;DR: RG used to be an inept politician but he improved a lot in the run up to the 2019 election. He could have potentially been a competent PM. I think he reverse psychologyied them to not praise him so that they'll Here for the salt 🧂 😂 simp Excellent! Kudos to him Awesome!! Nice Incoming bhakt arguement

*arey bro tujhe pata nahi hai rahul gandhi kitna ganda aadmi hai usne ek ladki ka rape kiya tha apne dosto ke saath phir us ladki ka kabhi pata nahi chala* Guilt perhaps? I remember watching the December protests (after the rape) and noticing no one from Congress / UPA was responding to the outrage. In fact the protestors at Rashtrapati bhavan were dispersed using water cannons. Clearly the government understood mood of the nation and promptly shifted her to Singapore, knowing her death here would worsen the situation. 
Secondly, he was in a position of authority to bring in a legislation to treat minors as adult in heinous crimes. From all news reports it was clear that the juvenile was the most cruel and remorseless criminal, who actually pulled out her intestines... and due to legalities, he walked away without any penal consequences. Be a good man, but don't go around trying to prove it. Among all of this chaos, its nice to see that some mortality prevails even in the most challenging situation. This action, will speak louder than words—unless BJP comes with a mind-boggling narrative. Okay it's nice and all that, but this 2017 news. What's the point of patting his back now? Someone find a Modi article praising idk someone If the Gandhi family leaves congress forever, I may one day vote for it.
But currently, Congress doesn't deserve to exist. how it came out now then? no more a secret??? just curious.. This seems quite suspicious. Why they all of a sudden decided to reveal it? I can understand the sentiment to keep it a secret but it's hard to believe a news story like this. Especially with all the false news spreading these days. Find it hard to trust any of these politicians. [removed] And you believe it ? Corrupt politician pays money to gain sympathy from voters . Never heard of this before.

This happened under congress rule. One of the accused committed suicide under congress establishment. There were delays in providing medical support to nirbhaya , that is also a failure of the government. 

Gangsters like Dawood, and terrorist like Hafiz also do a lot for their communities, are they nice people too? Pappu Ans his family have systematically looted the country and everybody knows that. He way more neech human being than nice guy. Papu Aaj Pass Hogaya ;) ! Then why is he saying it out and getting published in online articles. Sorry can't believe it wasn't intentional.

You think the economy, the politics, the state, can be better managed and you have thoughts, theories and ideas on how.

Why do you allow yourself to be governed poorly (say)? Or, are you satisfied?",kammra," One, I don't want to go to jail. 

Two, a good proportion of dumb people means that my politics have to be dumb too, and something that will appeal to dumb minds. My dumb logic has to be right. This is very difficult, and only truly dumb politicians or truly smart politicians can pull this off. The acting level required is just too much.

Politics is too much of a commitment in a developing country. Real smart, committed idealistic people were once in politics. Most of us better educated, more intelligent people **today** are too practical to waste our lives in something where we are likely to fail. In our area there are a lot of educated middle class people who stood for elections, both local and national level. No one voted for them. These were people who are visible in local drives like trash cleaning, vaccination drives and other sundry matters. But no one votes for them. It is either BJP or Congress or some other established party. So its no use unless you have a lot of money to blow in deposit. I am not ready to sell my morality to the highest bidder yet. The IAS is an infinitely better option if you want the country to change. They are the ones who implement the policy in the first place rather than the politicians who are just there to sign. If anyone's name is Arnab please don't answer this question.

(Check out OPs username)

Edit: /s What is preventing you from joining politics? 
As for me, I'm just part of the pipeline that everyone goes through. A sheep, not a leader. I follow or remain ignorant. It's true that I am sorely disappointed by the state of affairs and want things to change. But that doesn't mean I would want to join politics. I can rather become an occasional activist and focus on my original passion. Joining politics needs a lot of commitment and thus time, which would just lead me to stray from my actual passion. So yeah, occasional activism works better for me. I am an introvert. I can't go around campaigning. Nor do I have funds it needs even give a decent fight. And I can't go around begging for funds too. But if I do get elected, say through RS, I would be willing to join politics and do the job. I think it's not a level field with all the goons currently present. Unless you have backing of some political group (which defeats the purpose), it is nearly impossible for a middle class guy to risk my life including the life of my family. While I know risks and can understand we need people who can work for common people and poor, it won't go unnoticed by the corrupt that I will be exposing a lot of their shit on the way. My political opinions are illegal. A few crores. The people of this country elected Modi twice. I can understand wanting to show congress that its hold on the nation is done for. But electing someone - who doesn't even have a degree, can't hold his own in unscripted interviews, believes in ancient Hendu Stronk bullshit etc - a *second time,* makes me not want to do *anything* for this country. [removed] I was a member and still support a small party called Loksatta. They contested MLA elections in 2013 and Bengaluru municipal elections in 2015. Our candidates always came third or lower (behind BJP and Congress). It was disheartening. We put in money from our own pockets. Campaigned on the issues that matter. And yet, I saw first hand, how the so-called educated voters still view elections with a communal mind (religion and caste). I saw BJP and Congress workers openly bribing families in slums. That's when I realized it's hard. Delhi and AAp's victory was an exception, not the norm. India will remain a third world country because much of its people vote based on all the wrong priorities. The day voters hold leaders accountable for real important matters will be the day parties like AAP or Loksatta gain nationwide acceptance. But sadly I do not see that happening anytime soon. 1. Most elections are determined by campaign expenditure 
2. People don't have the time, knowledge, awareness or critical thinking to assess their options 
3. Politics has always been dirty and there is a very real chance of losing life and limb if you flip off the local mafia which is often also the local politician's family

&#x200B;

You can still donate to the candidate you favour, if not in money you can volunteer, join their campaign and use your skills to help them win. Also, I am useless. I am honest and cannot dupe people. I like being alive I am some one who believe that an Individual has to think about his own development and making himself strong financially,mentally etc while not at all obstructing the development of fellow individuals . All these individuals make up the country and inturn mean that country will develop along with them . It is such a development where we no longer need any leader . Thus i stay away from politics . I know it sound unreal and cringy, but that is what i think . Have you joined politics?
If not, what prevents you from joining? Iam not a yes person, politics requires yes people I need a godfather to enter in politics Just because one is disappointed with something, it doesn't warrant participation. If you aren't happy with a meal, you don't try to become the chef. You can complain and try to set things right or you just go where you find better food. There are millions who are sick of this country, not all of them are going to join politics. And just joining politics will in no way give matters into your own hands. I'm not 'allowing' myself to be governed poorly because I exercised my right and voted for whom I believed in, the problem is that person/party didn't win which is beyond my control. But is it really feasible for a graduate to take politics as a career? Don't have public speaking skills [deleted] >So wise men and women of India, what's preventing you from taking matters into your own hands? 

Can you tell me (or point to some document) the path I should follow if I want to do this? Assuming that I am a nobody in politics or social/public work. I want a team of well determined persons...people whom I can trust...those who can go without bread for a day if needed...guess it's only me..plus I have no money...without money you cannot do anything substantial...if you go to the root of problems...maybe your brain will pop out of your head...if not you have underestimated the problem itself ....because individual capacities are only marginally different compared to the problems we are facing...  
People like Gandhiji can bring a change but they come once in many years...until large number of individuals are committed to become gandhi themselves (given only few succeed)...there is no hope even if you join politics...playing a moral game is a titanic task Joining politics, aahh, I used to think about this. But when I saw the ground reality i.e. the issues of each constituency differ on the basis of caste/religion and class issues + the very fundamental issues of roti kapda makaan which have existed right from independence. 

Most of our citizenry hasn't been provided with the bare basics i.e. Food security, employment opportunities, law and order, and education.

Most of us fight to fulfill all these needs.
Inme se, jo bhi populist politicians provide/promise karte hain, vote unhi ko milta hai. (basically violating election spending norms all the time, everywhere)

Fir votes milte hain religion and caste based - state sanctioned benefits k basis pe.  
So one needs resources, popularity, and good presence (on stage and in the news)

Plus if one talks sense like how farm loan waivers are bad for the economy (empirically proven), then they'll be shown the door by the voters as they fall for the narrative created by opportunist politicians.

Also, very few voters can visualize the long term effects of any policy pursued by a government. Jab tak uske positive effects dikhte hain, another government gets the credit for it and vice versa. Public memory is actually very short lived. 

So unless we improve the standard of education and thereby critical thinking, I believe, we, as a populace, deserve the politicians we get. After all, politicians are a mirror for our society.



So I'll rather watch the fall of Rome from the comfort of my home,on WiFi. :P Itna Ameer nahi hai Mera baap Come from middle class family, don't have much backup. Need to work to build backup Money, personality, and mainly money. My bad habit of telling the truth !"

They have landed entire BJP Army for Delhi Elections - Modi, Shah, Goyal, Yogi, Jawdekar etc. against small party. Politics badalne aaye hain hum... Arvind Kejriwal.

Edit: ( We are here to change political discourse.. Arvind Kejriwal)

Guys he was not kidding. If your rivals respect you, you are doing great Shiv Sena? It's like Himmler praising the Brits for kicking Hitler's ass. What's happening? And for that reason only , hope Kejriwal Wins .. hope Delhities don't vote for those who try to divide us Indian's .. Don't forget that shiv sena stopped the mumbai arey shed tree cutting. 
   And paused the bullet train project because who the fuck would want to go to ahmedabad. It should have never been Mumbai -ahmedabad but
Mumbai-delhi these are most important routes.
  And because of modi not much ships dock at mumbai he moved them to gujrat motherfucker stelling our money by moving trade to his state.
     Many people complain of sena being a gunda sarkar how it has ties to don type people of mumbai. But then this has been past. But then it is far better then supporting bjp.
  Now the ruling gov is a 3 party of sena ,ncp and congress. This is far better then bjp whose CM used to say ME PUNHA YEIL ME PUNHA YEIL ( i will come back again) thank god he isnt cm now.
Because of bjp maharashtra is in its  highest debt in its entire history.

     Most of maharashtra people are in support of AAP wish even we get this much facilities and had a CM like him. lol yeah no still fuck you shiv sena >**Hindu-Muslim politics**

Before making new allies ShivSena used to be headmaster of school of Hindu-Muslim politics and BJP master in Maharashtra. Now headmaster has gone on leave and will return on duty after some time but at this time the whole school is in the hand of BJP.

ShivSena is in quagmire. It had to quit this kind of politics in pressure (of allies). I think this is not good for ShivSena. It's Hindutva votes would transfer to the BJP and BJP would become more powerful in Maharashtra.

EDIT: Biggest gainer in this game is NCP and then BJP and even after winning CM seat I would see ShivSena as a loser because they have lost ideology on which their party was based on. Looks who is talking."

Since they know, with their lobbying power, and virtual oligopolies in such markets where they have a stronghold, it would be very difficult to reverse such benefits

Little wonder the Govt is opening up to hot money like ODI via FPI (and prolly even p notes will enter the scene soon), gives billions in tax cuts to chutiyas who in turn feed the electoral bonds but is woefully nonchalant about the unemployed and the farmers. Modi is even stealing money from LIC and Bhakt have no problem with it. Raghuram Rajan was an honest man who refused to bow down to Modi's demand to extract money from RBI. In Modi's New India, if you don't dance to the tune of BJP you will be thrown out of any post you hold. Sensex is high, our economy is working just fine........Oh wait. The only positive which is working in this govts favor is lower crude prices.  If it hits $100 a barrel for a couple of quarters, these jokers will be clueless on what to do.

I welcome this mature decision taken by RSS. This is normal expected behaviour but given their past, we must be appreciative of this cooperative stance taken by them Wait, what? RSS needs Tablighi , Tabligi needs RSS, both are theological based tribalism and each feed the other feeding suspicion and fear slowly poisoning society and creating theological base for them to feed on.

Fuck them both. What? Nothing? If they had said something slightly negative this would have exploded. This is a RSS classic. The footmen on the ground, the Godi Media, everyone unnamed will run narrative after narrative demonizing a target.

RSS head comes out and puts out a statement saying the most rational left leaning statement.

*world: pikachu_surprised.jpg*

Narrative goes one like nothing happened. Well said, RSS, credit where credit's due. They said these things too

Baad mai chhupe rehna, chhupana, jo jaanch kaarane ke liye aa rahein hai unki sewa ke liye unse behooda vyvahar karna, ye toh kuch vikruti ka hee darshan hai (to hide afterwards, to misbehave with those examining them, reflects some form of perverseness),” he said. 

“The way they are spitting is against the parampara (tradition) of India. Agar galti se kisi ko paer lagta hai toh hum namaskar karte hai (even if our feet accidentally touches someone, we apologise),” he added, stating, however, that the Tablighi members’ conduct was not a reflection on the entire community.

This is incorrect. They were as stranded as anyone after the lockdown because they went to masjids to preach and didn't have accomodations. Some were scared of coming out as from the community to be tested because of the backlash from everywhere. 

Even a lot of them were wrongly accused of misbehavior which was exaggerated where true and made up in other cases just because the media jumped on the hate bandwagon.
Luckily many police Twitter accounts clarified and made fake news media delete their claims.

Unfortunately all this made it further difficult to track and isolate them quickly enough to avoid spread to others. 

All that was needed was simple cooperation which would've made everything easier. Of course the non cooperation by few could be punished. But by singularly making claims that ALL of jamaat members are non cooperative etc..they just scared the shit out of them.

Don't people run away from quarantine?
Is it always because they're bad?
I think even thousands jamaat members suffered because of behavior of hardly few. Actually Tablighi Jamaat is pretty close to RSS ,  they are both political and use religion , TJ guys have real close contacts with some high ups in rss, vhp , and bjp also i don't be really surprised if in that conference or whatever, they din't have some of these guys as speakers , it is very common in TJ meetings. My reaction after reading this....""Hain"". 🧐 What universe have I got teleported into?? RRS=Tablighi jamat , both are filled with people with hatred and bigotry Good cop Bad cop. And let's not equate the two, one is a global group of Islamic purists (I would say similar to ISKON), while the other is an armed militia born out of Nazi inspiration whose ideology is rooted in jingoism, fascism, and Hindu-supremacy. **Let's not forget RSS is an literal terrorist organization**

It doesn't matter what they say. This is how mafias and ISIS works. I rubbed my eyes twice to see if this was real. *uno reverse card*"

I've been saying this since 1999. Heck even Bollywood made movies on this same issue over and over again. We respected Army to the core but also kept them on pedestal for these crimes as well. We never were blind supporters of anybody. That's why we were free to question every institution without fear. Today people say ""you are crazy to question Army"" and institutions? Well very convenient, who gave you that message, the perpetrators and it's supporters I guess. Well a Rapist never likes to be called out for the crimes he did, why would he support the idea of questions?

Rest of the points, you described India in general since 2014. And these same people had problems when petrol prices were 5 rupees high. Now they don't question even when it is +50 rupees high. Vegetables and rest other commodities +100 high. Because their brain has been washed. The media, the it cell, the zero pressure govt and it's institution, the fear mongering, has made people fearful and weak. 

Don't even for a minute ever think that this attempt to shoot was to create fear among Shaheen Bagh protestors. No, they are fearless and are not afraid to die even though they are dying slowly by protesting.

 This Shooting, Kunal's Ban, Azad's arrest, Rohith's suicide, Kanhaiya's false allegation not amounting to police chargesheet, Kalburghi+Pansare+Dabholkar+Gauri Lankesh Murders, Akhlakh+Pehlu Khan's Murders, Child Asifa's Rape in Temple, Judge Loya's not so mysterious Death, Bhima Koregaon investigation pulled off, etc etc...everything has been done to show the people of India, DON'T REPEAT WHAT THEY DID OR YOU'LL FACE THE SAME FATE. My dad is an air force vet, and he himself questions the morality of soldiers who indulge in such heinous activities and soil the army's name. However, he never blames the army, he targets that specific group of soldiers who have done this. Remember, the day we stop questioning our own army, we become Pakistan. u/WhenBlueMeetsRed you can post your bigotry and hatred here instead of sending private messages :) We all want peace of mind . For you its Kashmir , for me its SC/ST act . 

Yes , we all are culprits because its OUR gormint.  > Islamic terrorism in kashmir is geopolitical armed struggle. 
 > If you're indian, kashmiris are not your people. 

Kashmir can't survive on it's own, the minute it separates it'll be attacked by china/pakistan or shared between them. Google the condition of pakistan economy or how muslims are treated in china.
The ""geopolitical armed struggle"" you talk about is Terrorism. You can believe or not. The armed strugglres don't ram their car into army convoy killing 40 army personnel and their worthless self. 

It's people like you who really fucks the credibility of left. You can't counter extremism by extremism. I think being politically illeterate is not a problem. Not knowing all the facts and choosing sides or forming opinions is worse. [deleted] You know bin Laden said the same thing to the victims of 911 to justify the attack. We pay our taxes, if government misuses it then it's not fault. We are civilians. That doesn't mean I support human rights violations, but it is wrong to attack civilians. So what do I do if I don't believe what you believe in? Because you didn't say why you believe what you believe.

I do support your right to peacefully protest though.

Also protest were supposed to be about CAB, NRC now with free Kashmir you are giving arsenal to right wing mob who will use this to show how unpatriotic the left wing is. ""Indian occupation of Kashmir"" 
Lol Aaj tujhe detain kiya. Kal main same poster uthaunga. Kitna detain karenge. Karlo jitna mann kare. Main ghoom kar wapas aaunga!

I mean, aren't you doing the same here? Aren't you distancing yourself from reality, which is that India will always be an imperialist, revanchist nation? Our complete absence of any base culture is going to make us permanently lust for lebensraum to fulfill some glorious historical ideal or other.

I don't disagree with anything you've said in your post, but I am disappointed in the Indian left's continued obsession with keeping the Indian project going. This nation's existence will always be a threat to Kashmiris, adivasis, the north-east, the list goes on. We - the left, not liberals - should proudly throw ourselves behind the worthy goal of dismantling India and replacing it with a union. 

There was no hope for reform within the British Empire - there is no hope for reform within India. The sooner we accept this, the better it is, for our own mental health and for future progress."

r/BoneAppleTea material there /r/madlads *gesture (grammar Nazis unite) Other people would like to travel in peace and quiet. Uh in all honesty, if someone approached me on a flight to start a 'debate' I'd probably ignore them as well. Not saying Arnab did the right thing but seeing the video, Kamra was just out of line trying to get a reaction. It just made him look bad and gave more ammunition to the opposition. Please don't say Arnab does the same thing on his show. You don't have to get in the mud with him to prove your point. Be the better person. Could someone explain to me why Arnab Goswami should be pressured into having a conversation with someone with whom he does not wish to at the time? 
I get that the comedian is mocking him with his own words, but when someone is traveling and is on a flight, should their personal space not be respected? 
I hardly find this funny because it seems to me like a cheap jab at someone who does not wish to comment at a particular time when anything he could have said could be taken in a wrong light.
Personally, I am of the opinion that this anchor rarely speaks of relevant news and if he does it's hard for him to continuously say relevant information for a while and it's actually better that he's silent. I don't think I can take Kamra seriously any more, especially after [this](https://twitter.com/vivekagnihotri/status/1222371368920068096?s=19) expose of him. It really shows he has built an image by being anti-modi and is not in pursuit of a true political analysis but simply uses the ""Modi Bad"" jokes to build a core fan base.

> In the interview, when asked by Kamra “Which is the most effective fake news”, I said ‘Rohith Vemula’.

> Kamra agreed and said, ‘but it worked against Modi. And how.”
“You’d sell suicide of a student to beat Modi? I asked.
“Why not? It’s all fair in politics.” Kamra said.

Don’t get angry, don’t be condescending; calmly, logically bust myths, patiently explain concepts (even if it’s repeatedly) and slowly but steadily build a critical way of thought.

Hopefully this chain reaction snowballs into something worthwhile.

It’s tedious, but people need to be taught how to fish instead of handing the correct fish out (which, arguably they were historically handed out) What you describe is true.

There is one big thing though. You are giving the impression that these things are an anomaly. You are implying that these things can be fixed. Both are wrong premises, if you were implying them.

The vices everywhere are not accidental. They are the result of careful engineering by RSS. And there is no fix for them. That is because RSS has become a great force in India. And there is no counter force."

* United Andhra pradesh : 42 seats, breakaway party = YSR Congress

* maharashtra : 48 seats, breakaway party = National Congress party

* Chattisgarh : 11 seats, breakaway party = janta Congress Chattisgarh

In all these 143 seats, Congress was earlier a strong player. In fact, a strong performance in Andra pradesh in 2004 by Congress was the reason vajpayee lost power in 2004.

Congress needs to become more democratic where aspirations of regional leaders are allowed to flourish.

Not mentioned here, Himanta Biswa Sarma who left Congress in frustration due to lack of decision making and joined bjp. He is the primary reason behind BJP's rise to power in North East . Congress handling of him was a massive self goal

And why should we care?

Congress is responsible for its own downfall and we don't owe them anything. 

As far as defeating BJP is concerned, congress is the biggest roadblock. Whenever congress is the biggest opposition in a state, BJP ends up winning easy or forms govt afterwards anyways. Mamata is holding her fort in WB, Kejriwal maintained his status in Delhi and Sharad Pawar halted BJP in Maharashtra. The country will be much better without the carcass of congress. Congress has tried to decimate local leadership since Rajiv Gandhi time . Remember when He humiliated sitting Andra CM in an Airport which led to congress losing to NT Rama Rao in 1982.

And since then this has always been a time honoured tradition of Gandhi family clear out any regional leader who may challenge their in future. 

They never showed any respect any regional leaders and only ones mattered were if you in their inner circle.Afterall this is their property so who can complain. Congress have themselves to blame. In regards to the Telugu states; few policy decisions were being made at the central level and many politicians used the word ‘high command’. The word high command even permeated into pop culture where it was parodied and used in movies, and people used to joke about it. 

After YSR’s death, the word high command became commonplace. It was embarrassing. People hated being controlled by a person sitting 1500kms away. They became spineless. All that Congress wants at the moment is for things go to so so bad that people just end up voting for Congress and Rahul Gandhi can be the PM. 

Their insistence on not having a non-Gandhi PM candidate is crushing. They are proving everyone right in calling them a dynastic political party. Congress doesn't have anyone but itself to blame.

They actively refrained from campaigning in West Bengal and Odisha in 2019, and allied with wrong parties. For all practical purposes Congress is a relic of the past. 

Muslims used to vote for Congress. Now they have nowhere to go. They must organize their own Hindostan Party which would include every one except the Hindutva adherents. And they must do it fast."

These two are blamed for all of India's problems and people are stupid enough to believe it. 




Honestly, as a dalit I sometimes wish let them remove reservation. Then let them explain to masses how 1% Indians are getting 73% Indian wealth. Within decade there will be riots in streets and true people responsible for Indian poverty will be found out. Sizable dalit tribal population doesn't understand how system is rigged against them, they think reservation is making some difference. These guys can finally wake up. You have 22.5% reservation for 29% SC,ST in government jobs which are just 4% of total jobs. And people think this is useful or something. The main question we need to ask is where are the damn jobs ? I have said previously that Scheduled Castes and Tribes are next on the list after Muslims.

Looks like I was wrong. They're targeting everyone at the same time, just with a different approach. >The other problem is also the court’s selective affirmation of the state’s discretionary powers for providing reservations. When it comes to a decision not to provide reservations, the court feels the state has absolute discretion and need not collect data to justify this decision. But when the state wants to provide quotas, the court brings in the concept of equality and places several restrictions that dilute the discretionary power of the state. The 50% ceiling for quotas is an example of this restriction.


This alone is enough to show how the SUPREME COURT is disingenuous and biased as hell and their end goal isn't equality of any sorts. First they stopped making it compulsory for promotion in government jobs and now will give only lower level jobs to reservations.
Second they stopped compulsory arrest in SC/St act and will give pree arrest anticipatory bail to the accused.

This is the destruction of the act itself. 

Bc reservation is not the government spooge to give its a bloody constitutional right. Get that modi shah I wish the govt does try fucking around with the reservations. I truly pray that they somehow think that by making their stooges pass such judgements that they can alter the basic tenets of reservations and try curtailing it. It will be the end of this govt. Period. Come on BJP/RSS! Try messing with reservations. Please. You can do it!! Show us how tough you are. First Moslems , now SC/ST ; good job BJP judiciary /govt . Golly what is with this government? Talk to upper caste, and they believe BJP is shit and giving SC/ST everything. Talk to SC/ST, they say its upper caste party

Who the fuck voted for these mfs? I believe reservations  should be based on economic conditions and not on caste.
The reason is many sc's and st's have a high family income yet take advantage of reservation.
On the other hand there are many general candidates that have very low family income yet have no such advantage.

Reservations(if any) should be used to lift the distressed classes and not lift the already uplifted."

I know I'm helpless and and that my rantings are futile but I can't force myself to not care. It seems I've internalised the issues and thus let the problems outside and beyond me hurt me more than they should. With PM Shah, PM Bisht and PM Surya just rearing to lead our society to newer and newer heights of idiocy over the next half century, it's gonna be the longest bloodiest comedy series ever in the history of mankind.

But on a +ve note, few expected 5-6 months ago to see so many students protesting, chanting preamble, and irritating the beardos no end. Fewer still expected foreign govts to criticize the govt so scathingly. For now, nothing stops each of us from trying to find ways to help potential victims. So, it is a dark comedy series but with unexpected flashes of optimism once in a while. Ah I see you're a man/woman of culture as well. We have to understand India has Multi-Party Political System with 1.4 Billion People. The Biggest Democracy on Earth. Unlike USA which has only two Political parties with two ideologies. In China there is only One Communist Party with No Election at all. There are at least 50 major regional Political Parties in India. All Parties have different Ideologies like Communism, Socialism, Nationalism, etc. Hence there is lot of noise in India. People don't know what to follow. Every Party wants to win election. So naturally they do lot Appeasement and Vote Bank Politics for their vested Interest. They spread Propaganda and False narrative. People should use their own Mind to make sense. k"
Politics,Losing friends over politics.,117,emb3gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/emb3gi/losing_friends_over_politics/,67,1578612313.0,"I've been critical about Modi from the start and a lot of my friends have been bjp supporters. I'm talking about 2014 LS elections. I used to share memes and all online, they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendship. But last month since Jamia incident, it reached my saturation point and I'm just posting against the govt and all without any self censorship or considering about their feelings, posting photos and videos from protests I'm participating in and they've started losing their shit. I've lost so many friendships since then. I didn't care and have no regrets until recently, a really good friend of mine,a school friend, uploads demonstration he's participated in support of CAA. I would've blocked if it were any other person but I gave him benifit of doubt. Talked to him. We were having a productive discussion until the point he started justifying the actions taken by UP police and Delhi Police. UP police raiding homes was ""teaching them a lesson"" and ""maintain law and order"". I got so rattled with such a response. He never was like this. We have such wonderful school memories together. He's never been this venomous. I'm in a dilemma and don't know what to do next.",kingslayerz33," I have. I've ditched almost all my friends from school-time. To be honest, current political issues are much more than regular 'politics'. In this political climate, some people are showing disturbing shades of personalities. It is much more than just a difference in political opinions. It is about humanity. If a person shows something negative in this regard, try to fix it. If cannot be done...sayonara. [deleted] Circumstances like these are when people show their true colors. Use this as an opportunity to weed out shitty people from your life. Good riddance. Aisa kachra life mein na ho to behtar hai. Deleted a close friend from my friend list because of the constant propaganda he was sharing on my timeline. So much hatred for Muslims even though he himself was in a relationship with a Muslim girl I lost 3 friends, one being my throughout school friend. I think I still have no regrets standing for what’s correct :) This is the biggest crime that Modi & Shah are guilty of: destroying the social fabric of the country through the use of classic propaganda and brainwashing techniques, but using social media. No other politician has achieved this on such a scale.

The only people who escaped the spell of these two rogues are a small minority who are naturally sceptical about everything. Looks like your friend didn't escape the spell.

It is no coincidence that the growing opposition to ShahModi now is coming from young people, who have a better understanding of how media manipulation works and who possess a natural scepticism about things that their parents' generation blindly believes in. I haven't lost friends but I'm seriously reconsidering breaking up some friendships. A lot of people aren't really having a lot in their lives to talk about and it's easy to talk about politics. 
I have always been a centrist in my political views and it seems as few want me to join their ""team"". It's a dirty game, but you don't have to play it. I can be your friend OP :) Sad, but I went through this just the other day. I knew he was a bhakt, but not such a violent one with such low regard for human life. Long story short, it wasn't even a discussion, he outright started abusing me because I shared a post on my feed about keeping personal information safe, etc. Minutes later, a friendship of 13 odd years just disappeared. It's better to cut these kinds of people out, the sooner the better. They: don't lose friendship over politics, yaar


Me: Can't lose friendship over humanity, yaar. Goodbye. Why do you want to be friends with such a bigot? Welcome to my world buddy. You are in the same boat as I. My best friend has turned into a soft bhakt and justifies every action of the govt one way or the other. He is one of the kindest man I know and about 80% of his friends are Muslims and yet the cognitive dissonance persists. The only difference between our situations is we do not post memes and articles in our common group. We both know where the other stands politically and I call out on his bullshit if he open his mouth regarding the CAA or NRC debacle but we keep it respectful.

We don't name call each other. We have a mature conversation and usually never come to an agreement. The only thing I ever said that was harsh was that hope he doesn't stand on the pavement while his muslim friends are being hauled into an uncertainty and shouting that they should get into the vans because the govt said so. He kept quiet and never spoke about the CAA issue with me ever again. We meet now and talk about life in general. Keep politics minimal. There is a tacit understanding that we value the friendship more than our political differences. I remember a quote from a game which aptly describes your dilemma , it goes like this '' Friends, who want to remain friends, don't discuss religion or politics''.

But, we need to draw a line somewhere, if your friend starts justifying premeditated  violence on innocent citizens, then it's time to start evaluating your friendship. Kanhaiya Kumar actually raised this point in his recent speech at JNU. Modi is dividing families and friends. *First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,* ***then they fight you***, *then you win* Distance yourself from these venomous snakes. Indian people don't know about the term ""opinion"". They are stupid and have a mentality of if your opinion is not same as mine, fuck you! I was just saying today how this moment in time has brought out the true colours of so many people we know. On one hand it's shocking to see the hate and utter stupidity but on the other it's heartening to see the good. 

You need to decide whether you're okay being friends with these people. They aren't just people who have a difference in political opinions. They're straight up hate-mongering, blood-thirsty, bigoted pieces of filth. Recently I have lost my good friend too. He doesn't used to be like that, but he is acting differently. He started saying that most of the muslim doesn't know what actually CAA and started the crap. Then he said after explaining these thing to muslim dominated  community in bangalore everyone changed their mind and they are in support of CAA. A convenient story to dismiss ones view, I am sure he is using the WhatsApp forward messages. Then I argued with him that CAA itself is unconstitutional as you are discriminating on the basis of religion. Then he started saying this is very emotional matter to him, started crying about Hindus in other country. I said u could take the persecuted in your country regardless of religion or country. Then he said we cant take everyone as we have enough population so discarding few of them. I had enough explaining him about this but he is not listening and asking me to change my mind. If this is the case then they weren't WORTHY friends to begin with

I assume liberal Germans lost a lot of friends to Nazi politics

U know they stayed silent and what happened then?

SS killed all Liberal activists. U r speaking up and not submitting to authority that's why Modi is silent else he wud have impose 144 everywhere. Jab tum mehgayi berozgari or Mandi ki baat karoge to main tumhe Hindu muslim me uljha dunga

ache din aagaye Mitrooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn >they saw it but the difference of opinion never affected our friendship.

that's because you're a privileged ""moderate"" who prefers negative peace to positive justice. politics always affects people you were just privileged enough to not care. See if he your true and old  friend, then you should not care about his political views at all, like seriosuly just don't discuss politics with everyone or scrutinize everyone's social media post. It is not worth it family and friends are made not of similarity of political views but on relations and experiences. .


Please don't consider doing a weeding out or something like that of friends over political views or stuff, it would just leave you friendless in an echo chamber of ""new friends"" with only common thing being politics. There is much more to life than modi or politics, just discuss that...there is like a 1000 issues to discuss which you guys might see exactly same, why fight over one thing you guys differ ????? People who support murderers and criminals are accomplices

I don't want to be friends with criminal accomplices Welcome to the boat! I am also trying to reason out with friends as much as I can. 

One question I got asked is ""Look at the situation of West Bengal, these immigrants are creating violence and chant anti national slogans. Why should we tolerate them?""  


I am not too aware of the realities in West Bengal though. Is it that only immigrant Muslims cause trouble there? Can someone please enlighten me about the above point. I feel like Social Media has a huge part in this. 10 years ago, no one would talk about politics in person with the kind of intensity we use on social media. How old are you? 


I had to cut off ties and leave my the WhatsApp groups for the same reason during the first week of strikes. It was appalling to see people who I have known for years to defend the violence/BJP. 

I’m at an age where I don’t want myself to be surrounded by enablers. Everything was “changa si” with labels and stuff but if one comes around and defends/justifies the kind of violence which happened on 15/12 and 05/01, then piss off, mate. This happens when we grow balls to talk about something we are invested or excited in. But honestly, given your description, it's just a difference of opinions. Maybe go to their place, spend time with them, but don't bring up this topic. Remember JNU came now, these are your old friends. Are you really open for discussion? No, because when you post something ""without censorship"" others should be OK but when someone else has contrary view to you start with a judgement (you mention you gave him benefit of doubt) that they are somehow wrong or misguided and you are not. Then you mention you talk to them (rather convince them to switch sides) and when they too present their uncensored opinion, you get rattled.

As it turns out, there is United Nations genocide convention that defines the term, and what happened to the Sikhs, while likely a crime against humanity, does not meet that definition, says Frank Chalk, a Concordia University history professor and past president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars.
While the  victims were clearly targeted because of their religion, the killings were not part of a “long-term, sustained and systematic” effort, perpetrated by government, to wipe out the Sikhs, which is how genocide is described in the UN convention, he said. No one cares about Jagmeet In Canada. He is a Sikh version of Rahul Gandhi"

Politics,[What if] Our national parties collapsed and only regional parties remained: what would Indian politics be like?,16,f433wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f433wd/what_if_our_national_parties_collapsed_and_only/,22,1581762769.0,"If you think this is a stupid question, that's fine. It is obviously nothing more than a thought experiment.

But Prakash Javadekar's statement about BJP losing Delhi because of Congress's failure made me think about it. May it is true that BJP will not be able to survive without the Congress as its opponent. They've been unable to fight any regional party on home turf quite consistently. If we had more regional parties would it be so difficult to imagine an India without BJP or Congress? 

How would national coalitions be made? North vs South? Hindi vs non Hindi? I have no idea. But the possibility excites me. What do you think? 


Taking a side step, splitting Andhra resulted in Congress losing the state and two regional parties talking over. Maybe splitting the larger states could accelerate this process? Spitting MP said did not have the same effect, so I know it is not a reliable way to do it. Just thinking out loud here.",HairLikeWinterFire," I believe this is how it should work. People must vote for the party who they believe will work best in their constituency, not for the party who they want to see in power at the Centre. So many things would change.

Right on the money, Hindi-Belt needs to be thoroughly fragmented into equivalent political units to  kill the Hindutva Majoritarian sentiments and also to promote more competitive federalism. 

Until that happens, regional aspirations such as Rajasthani, Maithili and Bhojpuri gaining independence from the 'Hindi dialect' tag is impossible.

>Hindi vs non Hindi?

Run away.",BoozeCroc," We need to teach critical thinking and formulating proper arguments. And then begin asking questions to teachers and parents, who mostly don't like their authority to be questioned. Things follow from there. lol, gave me a chuckle. My uber-serious Indian girlfriend broke up with me because she couldn’t stand up to her Dad’s emotional brainwashing.
We were almost engaged 😅 Indian family structure is oppressive inherently. Schools, media, family, everything is geared at teaching a concept of respect that makes it difficult for Indians to counteract against families. Those who do are rubbished throughout the extended families as black sheep.

What needs to happen is a change in our system of education as well as the current generation being better parents to their children, enabling them an opportunity to be critical thinkers. Exactly! Though I believe that this had it's roots in our culture as well as the education system. From childhood itself, the idea of unquestioned adherence to our parents and teachers is instilled quite deeply, and the same people lose the ability to question any kind of authority and grow up to become obedient peons of the society. They have no idea that what is taught to them is not always the right thing, and that there's always a different perspective to look at things. As long as this doesn't change, no amount protests is going to make a difference. Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully teachers in school.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully managers in work places.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully relatives in their families.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to those bully bigoted unkills spreading vitriol in whatsapp groups.

Also, Indians need to learn to stand up to the truth and accept it, and not be crying like a whining b*tch.

Also, Indians need to learn to call a piece of shit a piece of shit, a scumbag a scumbag, an arsonist an arsonist, a rapist a rapist and so on. I could not agree with you more. This is primarily one of the reasons why Indians are so docile and meek when it comes to defending their own ideas. It is primarily because since childhood, they are covered under the shroud of ""culture"" and ""riwaz"" and adults are these infallible and unerring beings who you should always listen to and never ever question their authority, even in a polite and civil fashion.  Not to mention that if you do veer off against the ideology of your parents, sometimes the consequences can be dire as you can be abused physically, mentally or be outright abandoned. 

This is the reason why we hesitate so much to speak out against corrupt politicians, abusive policemen or local netas; it is because the idea of blind respect is forcefully drilled into our brains from a very young age. Unlike western countries, we don't have child protection agencies who look out for the welfare of kids and parents can pretty much get away with anything they do to their children in the name of ""discipline"".

I wholeheartedly believe that if Indian parents did a proper job of raising kids, we'd have a better society overall which would question people in leadership, would be more confident and assertive, and would possess the ability to comprehend what is right and wrong on a larger level.  Unfortunately when you raise kids in the environment of fear, jealousy and hate, you have the contemporary India that we can all see. Dont give up guys. I have changed my parents outlook to somewhat extent. Hope you will also after trying. Indians do need to stand up to their parents whenever it is necessary, especially for life changing situations such as further education, marriage, life and so on. 
But, the problem is Indian kids are so fearful, that they hide even their basic relations with boyfriends/girlfriends for fear of being disowned. Indian kids depend on money from parents, at times upto even 25 years or even 30 years. Parents use these tools to control kids in their later life. 

Heck, in my family, my own sister who's a ""strong independent woman"" can't convince her boyfriend to elope because that dude is a complete mama's boy which makes me want to tell my sister to leave him because he's such a coward. The dude has a Master's degree and yet has never even heard of the Special Marriages Act. That's the society today, literate yet illiterate; educated yet fools; brazen yet cowards. My mother uses kundalis and religious teachings generously to keep us controlled, usually backfiring tremendously at the expense of the entire family. Almost always there is an unhealthy dose of arguments.

Why are there more than 2 lakh engineering students unemployed in India today? Why is there a lack of lawyers in India? Why is there a lack of legit thinkers in India? Why is dissent being shunned? All because elders are ""always right, and anyone below the age of 40 is a child, and children know nothing""! 

I believe in being rebellious all the time... This is to get answers to questions no one is ready to answer. Have a good day! :) A friend of mine told me how he stood up to his bigoted af uncle. When he started on his usual hate-filled rant about how Muslims are ruining this country, my friend started recording. The point was simple - if he has the conviction, and feel what he is saying is the truth, then he shouldn't be scared to air his views. Needless to say, he couldn't.


Edit : A word Ran away from my shit-hole of a home last year and moved to a brand new city thousands of kilometers down south. And I've never been back. Fuck Indian Parents and the toxic society that acts as an enabler to them.

Also, /r/AntiNatalism. We follow a feudal structure in India, along with strong patriarchy.

Even Hinduism is feudal in nature with its caste system.

Everything needs to broken to be remade.

*Sigh*
If only it were possible in our lifetime. Yeah when you don't rebel a bit, they never change. And a lot of people think they'll be disowned for the smallest of arguments. Remember they need you more than you need them after a few years.

I showed mine graphic videos of lynching and they finally disapproved what was happening. Agreed. Indian parents want the youth to emulate Bhagat Singh, only not their own spawn. saar, mummy khaana nahi pakayegi toh mar jaungaa Yesterday I had a heated argument with my dad, conservative, over the CAB and its protests. I can't believe an Engineer like him can be so illogical and blind to balance. Like, you're either supporting CAB because of emotional, irrational bias to BJP (Which is wtf, has the party sucked your cock off or what. Why the blind faith? Bhagwan thodi hai?) Or because of apathetic majoritarian mindset.

Either make me embarassed and disgusted at my father. Called him stupid and emotional for supporting the bill. F*ck this so called culture/traditions. Be free! be independent! But first move out of your parent's basement! the phrase ""mai baap sarkaar"" exists for a reason. Instead of the government serving the people, the default assumption in India seems to be that the government is doing you a favor  by ruling and telling you what to do (witness demonetization, upcoming NRC etc). Bhai this is so true... Yesterday I was out shopping with my mom and the shop had a TV telecasting this... The keeper and my mom started slurring about them, ""aur karo protest"" and smirking. I felt so guilty. I did that today. My father understood. But jokingly called me a communist. I did, multiple times. Got beaten up too, multiple times. What a shot, what a shot! Totally agree. Hahaha truer words have never been spoken... Most of my friends are still shocked by how chill my parents are and always when i give advice of talking to parents for their opinion i often get ridiculed about it. 

Folks are just afraid of their parents even after being 25 plus. Haha

\*cries in cowardice and dependence on them\* Bhai kya bola hai.. tere muh me ghee shakkar. I agree with most of what you say but here is the thing. Its not your parents faults. Simple as that. If we think we are better than them in terms of our 'forward' and 'open minded' thinking then we also need to realize that our parents were born and brought up in a completely different era. We have no idea what they have been through. Those times were rotten with fear and depression.

Take for example my grandparents who lived during the fearful war days around 1940's and almost escaped a burning train during the India Pakistan division. My mom and her family lived in fear and oppression her entire life. She wanted to get herself educated from an English medium school but my grand parents could not afford her education. These were the days. Truly dark times.

Disagree as much as you want with your loved ones. Try to change their thinking but don't force your opinions on anyone for that matter. Try to put yourself in their shoes and just try to understand the world that they have come from

We are moving in a forward direction. The only direction in future is forward. If you don't believe that then you need to open your mind and see where we have come in the last 20 years with the rise of internet and just being able to openly voice our opinions on public forums and social media.

We will change. We will get better. Its going to take time. Probably another 100 years or more but we will get there. Just relax and do your best without hating or offending your loved ones by realizing that they didn't have the same privilege as we do today. They didn't get the opportunities to shine like we have today. So instead of trying to fight them, work with them and try to instill positivity in whatever you do in life. This world is not perfect. No human is perfect and nothing in this world will ever be perfect. Learn to appreciate what you have

Peace and love Maybe it's because I was born in the States, but I leaned in college to just tell me parents what they wanted to hear and then do whatever I wanted anyway. It did not work right away, and led to many fights, but eventually they realized it was my life and I needed to be in control of that. I still solicited them for advice and help, but the final decision is always mine. I don't think it really worked until a decade later when I proved I could make good money without having to be a doctor though. Since then I've advised Indian friends to do the same, but it's had mixed results. I guess it depends on your situation. I agree that it is important to stand up to your family for the things that you believe in. But I don't think any reason why we can't do the both at the same time. Changing people's attitudes is a process and it takes time, especially when you're dealing with your parents. Most of the time they dismiss you as being childish and suffering from the 'idealism of the youth,' and they can do that because they're your parents. 

But I do agree with you, we have to start the process at our home and extend it to wider society. Man, all these stories are making me so grateful for my parents. I'm gonna go now and hug my mom. [deleted] Sorry guys, but misinformed people are a greater threat to this country than any bad politician(Tadipaar and/or Jumlebaaz) Wow that hit right in the sanskar Reminds me of the Russell peters sketch, you have 15 minutes to call the police...tbh your problem is not a problem just in India, it's in other countries If you don't stand for anything you will fall for anything Sometimes standing up to the government is way easier than standing up to parents. It’s natural. Our parents have raised us, and our future is intertwined with them. Very often we are financially dependent on them till we are adults. The level of emotional blackmail possible is very high. Unless we are willing to be cut out of wills and ruin the relationships our children will have with our parents, standing up to parents will always be more difficult than protesting on the street. I would argue the former often needs more courage. Summed up exactlymy feelings..!Change starts from your home. This is so true. I am glad to know many people are thinking about this. hope is kinda lost for this generation's parents, hopefully it would be better from the Millenials onwards. Respect elders and respect teachers mentality needs to go, if I ever have childrens, I will teach them respect only the one's they deem it worthy of it Gold worthy Be financially independent then you can take your own decisions. First young Indians need to smash that bigoted uncle who keeps coming around your house spewing nonsense about poor people and other religious minorities. I’m sure you guys know who I’m talking about. Yaar, I've been standing up to my parents for years now. Pehle it was still better, they did listen. But modia has taken the better of them. It's so much worse now, they speak the modia speak, any evidence, any counter and any argument is fake news to them. It ends up in serious yelling matches no matter how we start it. Earlier there was doubt and suppressed belief that Muslims are bad, now it's a loud and proud truth for them that they want to oppress minorities. Talking politics has become a pain and a constant frustration in the family. My understanding is that Indian boomers lack any empathy, are submissive to the system, fear backlash and have only succumbed to capitalist consumerist materialistic lifestyles. Good luck with that. I gave up trying to reason with my mother. Being the only atheist in a family is difficult. My mother trying to convince me and me trying to convince her. It's a dead end. Not gonna work. I stood up to my parents when I was in my teenage years and they have given me space every since which has made me more confident. 

I was also very anti-establishment when I was younger but it has been clear for some time that both sides are shit including the JNU students, BJP, RSS, Congress and even those protesters in Assam. 

This subreddit is a great example of people not doing much research and going with anything anti-establishment.

Politics,My fears about how the current political situation would affect the Republic Day celebrations turned out to be true.,229,eu36ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eu36ic/my_fears_about_how_the_current_political/,36,1580048490.0,"I've been attending the flag hoisting at our colony's association building for years now. Our colony has always been a lot diverse in terms of religion. Everything was normal after the flag hoisting ceremony, members of the association gave speeches about our constitutional rights, fundamental rights and duties as well as secularism but it soon went downhill from that.

Another man from the colony started his speech about how our constitution and laws need amendments time after time and we should support them, and then he yelled that no matter what we believe we are must respect the national flag and national anthem and those who didn't do that or didn't return the cheer of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" are of no use to this colony or nation. An odd 4-5 people clapped at his statement after which he proceeded to yell ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and specifically pointed out this Old Muslim Man who wore a skull cap and came with his grandchildren of about 6-7 years of age that he wasn't cheering the same and he shouldn't stay here. When the old man started to leave, all the 10-12 association members and the president consoled him to stay while he was pulling away, his grandchildren started crying and the 20-25 odd schoolchildren who were there looked perplexed.

The old man decided to stay albeit being a lot sadder and angrier, yelling that he's been here longer than he has and is more patriotic than he ever will be. This incident was followed by the Association President's message that ""No person was supposed to force his beliefs and practices. Everyone has the right to cheer or not cheer for whatever they want"". He proceeded to apologise to the man for the speaker's words and invited him specifically to the function after this. The members of the association then proceeded to apologise and console him. 

Meanwhile, the man who gave the statement was being confronted by a single person for his words and was also being supported by one other man. He shook his hand and praised him for his words.

Ironically, the man who supported his words had stuck his paper flag on his heart turned upside down. 

This incident had me fuming but I calmed down after reminding myself that it was one guy (and the 4-5 odd people who clapped for him) against the 10-12 members and elders of the association who consoled the old man.

[Image from the incident](http://imgur.com/a/a4JA2Qb)

The man in the blue shirt and the red circle was the one who gave the speech, the man in the brown shirt and the blue circle was the man who supported him. The other man in white confronted him and counselled him for his words. I could add a voice record that I recorded out of fear and anticipation that something of this sort would happen.

TL;DR : Muslim man was told to leave the flag hoisting event by a person for not cheering ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" infront of  association members and children from the colony. Association apologizes and condemns his words.",XeroXeroIchi," What a shit-show. Hope the grandchildren remember the other members of the society who stood for their grandfather and not the bokachoda who thought it was appropriate to single out people and display his bigotry. Fucking morons everywhere. Fascist uncles always existed, the only difference now is that they're no longer afraid to speak or even feel obliged to make their racists views known in the name of ""nationalism"". As sad as this sounds, the beautiful thing is that people stood up for the Muslim man. In many cases that would not have happened. The current protests are clear evidence of the pushback and I'm glad it's finally happening. Hopefully it gets better. The muslim answer to such behavior is usually to settle in ""muslim areas"". hindus who can't stand non vegetarian muslims also create their own colonies.

Mist of mumbai is like this. Ghettoism starts this way. Hardly places where multi communities stay.Then theres a lot you'll hear from hindu communities about muslims and vice versa usually bad things and children believe them since they have never lived together with each other.

They'll probably go to different schools and meet each other during college but by that time be so stuck to their ideology that they'll completely ignore each other or be part of a radical group against each others communities.

Each group will have offenses by members of the other group to demean each other I don't know why some people associate chanting ""bharat mata ki jai"" with patriotism. Muslims never refused to sing National Anthem and ""Jai Hind"" and patriotism is not something which we can summed into a single slogan.Muslims do not chant ""bharat mata ki jai "" because it is conflicting with their religion they considered Allah the greatest of all ,that is why a muslim chanting "" bharat mata ki jai"" conflicting the greatness of their Allah.

It is the same way Hindus can not say ""Allahu Akbar(Allah is the Greatest)"" because saying it would be   putting Allah above other Hindus deities.
There are alot of miss understanding in our country regarding Muslims and Madarsas and Islam .Sacchar committee broke those myths but sadly government never took the report seriously.

India Is a Secular country ,and it was Secular before the 42nd amendment in which secular word added in the preamble.

Secularism is one the basic feature of the Constitution and Secularism can not be scrapped unless you scrap the Constitution. You should do a stand up at these things Same. My family decided not to go for this exact reason. Instead we went to family brunch. 

Drama isn't really worth it.

All minority members individually decided to go to separate family events. This brings back memories of my own colony. Good memories. We had people from all over India peacefully living side by side. That's why we can't give up idea of secular India. Rather than chanting bharat mata ki jai people should keep the country clean and become better people. When he originally yelled ""Bharat mata ki Jai"" everyone should have shouted ""Jai Bhim"". Why people organise Republic Day/Independence day , in colonies where illiterates live ? Sad. By the way what is the reason for Muslims to not say Bharat mata ki jai? This is just one of the many examples of how society has sadly been divided on religion. Nobody is saying that there were no issues before, but the way they have multiplied through fake, biased news and WhatsApp is sad. Society is being polarized and people are being brainwashed"

If you don't want to spend 20-30k on the lens, get the EF adapter and use one of the pancake lenses (24 or 40 f2.8) Fujifilm Xt20 with 27mm f2.8

Photography,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,7,dc6k28,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dc6k28/serious_how_would_people_in_india_react_if/,20,1570027532.0,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading.",desikid25," They will probably start unfollowing you or whatever it's called. You would probably not be having a straightforward conversation at that with those who find it offensive. I don't think so , Indian hot celebrities already have pics like these.

Make your art , have something unique in it.

People will appreciate. Create a new instagram handle, simple. Also talk to @framesbyankit Ashleel launda h - 3 idiots Mind telling us the insta account might follow u if it's good Logon ka kaam hai kehnaa... So don't worry about that...

Indians society is an epitome of hypocrisy, do what you do. Make your portfolio / career while it's possible. Those who like what you are doing will stick with you and back you.

All the best...
@shrikanthkarri on Instagram Stick to what you enjoy doing. People who will relate to your content will stick and support you.  
And trying new thing brings new opportunity to learn and experiment more. All the best.

I left taking portraits when I found my interest in Travel photography. Instagram (@xtermist) I my self am an amateur photographer and I post on Instagram. What my personal thinking is that, only people who are very close to you, like family might feel a bit weird per se. 

But other than that, your friends or people who really appreciate photography should be fine with  it. 

Personally, I don't think I can post any such pictures, I can't even post portraits of my friends smoking because my parents and close family follow me on Instagram. 

In conclusion, I think only your family and maybe teachers (i honestly don't know about them) will react oddly. But if you don't have a problem and want to showcase your are, please do so. It'll be a good experience and if you get negative feedback, you can always stop if you want. 

Hope this helped. 

P.S. Please share your Instagram photography page.

And check my page out 😁 @vmodani.photography Well post you thinking of bringing a bit of change to your style of photography...but whatever you do everyone is going to flip or act weird.

I want to find out a few things and I guess India could help me:
1. What are prospects of business?
2. How good is this as a career for not just survivability but to thrive? (I don't want to live in a mansion but yeah in long term a life where I don't have to worry)
3. What are different types of career options like I'm planning to do Product photography but what other than that, Wedding, etc.?
4. I'm about to complete my Bachelor's of Pharmacy (don't ask why Pharmacy, it just happened) but should I go for Masters Degree in Photography, I'm 22 years old.
5. What are good institution for photography courses and how to get an admission in them & other local classes where there are 6 months starter courses?
6. Where and how can I find work?",musterkin," I have a cousin who occasionally comes to Bangalore to get her photography taken from brands and freelancers. She’s very into the modeling industry.

She’s had lots of pictures taken, but hasn’t paid even once. One time a photographer traveled for over an hour just so he could take free pictures and put it on his Instagram.
This person as far as I can tell has done this a lot of times to gain some followers.
He still hasn’t succeeded, he still has 800 the last time I checked.

Luckily since he’s been helping out my cousin she started paying him for his pictures. 
I think she paid him 3,000INR for 4 hours of shoot.

It’s hard being a photographer. I reckon that’s the first time he got paid.
Now he seems to be doing fine getting more connections. This took him over a year though.
So it’s hard work and requires lots of traveling.
I haven’t answered your question properly, but hope it helps. If you have any questions let me know I’ll ask and let you know.

As for money, learning to code pays off big time.  I did mechanical and am currently freelancing.
I started off with just HTML, CSS and JS. Which is like majority of the work most clients need.
Currently taking a break to learn a few more skills, and learning to code for these past years has paid off.

Photography is possible as well, but I reckon finding a job is way more hard especially since so many have a Instagram photography page and will do it for free.
I wish you all the best :) [deleted]"

Then they will post a hundred irrelevant messages and wishes

Then the manager will travel abroad and post a bullshit picture in the group

After that everyone will praise the picture and the place

Subsequently they will marvel at the managers photography skills 

Lastly, if you do not partake in these conversations, they will ask you on your face what you were doing over the weekend and why there was no response from your end

Aap chronology samjhiye",chalkrow," Avoid work WhatsApp groups. Use a prehistoric phone for work and show them why you can't join WhatsApp. That'll shut them up. There is settings in whatsapp to restrict people from automatically adding you into groups I tell people I don't use whatsApp for privacy reasons (Facebook owned etc etc). Some went ahead and asked if 'something happened' :P. Or you can say you dont use it because you feel it takes up too much time. 

if you are wondering, I have all my close friends on telegram (yes they moved for me!.. i feel lucky)

I had to reinstall whatspp recently because 

* i moved to a new country and my parents only know how to use whatsapp
* handy-men (electrisian, painters, drivers etc).

I dont have a dp there and my status is 'Inactive' just to make it easier to tell people that its an old profile and I dont use it anymore. Don't share your WhatsApp number. If you do, just block the request to be added in group and do not entertain such requests in first place. The mediocrity will pull you down to their level. The mediocre is always looking for these-

More numbers. They want a big group.

Banal talks. They don't talk about anything remotely interesting.

Attention and appriciation.

Herd mentality. Everyone should be a conformist.

A dumb leader to praise.

It is not just your office but it is the theme of this country. try to move them over to slack, mattermost or skype. that will keep shit like this to a minimum.

Tell your manager in mattermost or slack it is easier to closely monitor your employees as an incentive to move them over. Man really appreciate that my colleagues don't give a fuck about your personal life. But realising I don't have a personal life, now I think might as well hang out with colleagues who gave a fuck. That's not your office. That's BJP Discord gang rise up!! Sycophancy? I thought it was just called ball-washing. 

It's been going for ages and is here to stay. 

The fake laughter to every botched attempt of the manager's 'humour', forced interest in his/her personal life and stories, the casual ass licks and kisses...corporate life is definitely not for the ones with an ounce of self-respect. Lol man. I remember one message that went - so nice you are, love working with you.

The occassion was the managers birthday Would you be in trouble to name & shame this company? Don't want you to get in any problem but curious to know (so I can stay away). You need to mute that group. I would've if I were you. Lol the moment this group was made I never said a single word. Pretending to not understand how WhatsApp works is so easy to explain. I wont do that. But If feel my manager is doing something stupid I will not tell him.  People like to be praised. This is exactly what used to happen when i was working in Swiggy .. *'tum input nahi dete'* - Le the CBH ...do you work with me? You've just described our work WhatsApp group to a T. >Lastly, if you do not partake in these conversations, they will ask you on your face what you were doing over the weekend and why there was no response from your end

Except for this part, the rest of your comment doesn't really show that it's sycophancy. I don't see anything wrong in complementing a photo posted by anyone of your co-workers or even boss etc or posting wishes and other stuff. Some people are just more extroverted and look to strike a conversation with others so sending wishes and all those other irrelevant groups messages etc.

Lastly, the tone in which they ask you why you don't partake in these conversations matters. If it sounds malicious and threatening then yeah, it's a problem. If not, then you've got issues(you're at best slightly anti-social and probably an introvert) and you're seeing too much into it. They're probably wondering why you're so quiet etc and trying to get you to open up more. In the latter case you can just be blunt to them and tell them you don't like the group cuz it's too spammy and leave the group."

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",okchinmayarawat," Slog through and get a proper job first side by side do photography. [Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o) I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first. The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby. Perhaps consider joining merchant navy and combine your education and passion. Check out videos of [JeffHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpdSarF_FdCygiA1tOl6Cg/videos) \- he does photography and good YouTube videos as a hobby while serving on a merchant vessel. Don't watch 3 idiots in a loop. >Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications

You can join photography college/school. There are many. Also look into online classes

If you've a DSLR, try practicing on your own. Shoot in manual. 

Also parallely, learn photoshop/GIMP/Lightroom. People find it tough. But post-processing is necessary specially when shooting Raw."

I might come off as rude and cynical but this thought has been bugging me for some time now.",thisisatypo," My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person’s hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person’s hobby.
P.S. don’t get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today’s smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai."

[Amazon.in](https://Amazon.in) is another option for almost all of it but, again, I’d prefer something local. I have a large list of equipment; the things I’ve had the most trouble finding are accessories:

* Arca-Swiss P1 S tripod head
* Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II backpack
* Feisol CT-3372 tripod

I’m also looking at high-end Nikon DSLRs and Nikkor lenses.

EDIT: Retailers in the NCR would be preferred.",Shivalicious," I am not sure in Delhi, but in every Indian city, old areas and areas which sell ""foreign goods"" always have the best Camera shops. I would hazard a guess that Pallika Bazar and Connaught is going to have the best of them. If it was Calcutta I could just say MM in Metro Gali. Photo market in Chandni Chowk. Its the biggest camera market in India. All professionals buy their gear from here

Photography,Visiting India,13,es78p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es78p7/visiting_india/,9,1579698430.0,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture.",casey_h6," Hey, welcome to India. You don't have to worry about street photography in India because people will come to you for selfie for sure. 

You are coming at right time. The weather is good, you can enjoy the food. Go to food streets, Taj Mahal (drive in afternoon), gardens, historical sights, India gate and more. Feel free to msg if you need any more detailed info. Hi, Welcome to India! I hope you have a great trip here, apart from business.
As such, I do not think you would have issues doing street photography, people generally do not mind. If you think someone would mind, just let them know - and they will tell you if they don't want. I guess it would only be women being photographed that you need to worry about. Mostly, be careful of your gear in public to avoid something getting stolen.
Buildings can be photographed, as long as they are not government buildings, which may land you in a soup. Some historic places require separate tickets for professional photography, be sure to buy that. Also, if someone heckles you over rules, stand your ground. People do this for money, but don't mean to hurt.
Please be vigilant while you travel specially in public transport. 
In Delhi, Red Fort, Qutab Minar, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Jana Masjid, Akshardham are must visit. You can also do Agra for Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri. Jaipur is also a short distance from Delhi, with great forts to visit.Golden temple in Amritsar is also very good option. It maybe be best if you can take a local along. Tourist places can be mad crowded.
Visit old Delhi for street food delicacies. If this is your first visit, bring a strong stomach and the food will not disappoint you. I guarantee.
Let us know how it went. Enjoy! Welcome! 

It's completely okay to take pictures, and if you're not too shy, it's completely okay to dance like a maniac, roll on the streets, whatever. If you're comfortable around people different from you, people might even interact in funny ways, ask for pictures with you, stare, etc. etc.

It's going to be very crowded, possibly polluted. Very hot, unless it's within a month from now. 

Places are qutb minar, red fort, etc. etc. just try to be assertive so as to not get fleeced, and preferably go early morning to avoid the traffic, if it's not to hazy for your pictures.

You can't do anything disrespectful to them. only in temples, you have the be barefoot, sometimes cover your head, sometimes photography not allowed, but you will get to know about all that there itself. Beware of shoe stealers, pickpockets, all that jazz. Very common. And no need for the namaste's, they never happen. Delhi is capital and crowded and is coldest in 100 years , and these all in delhi monument can be done in one day , my advice is to book a cheap flight and go to south where the good weather is , andaman or kerela see the natural beauty and good weather ,avoid north at this time as it is very cold

If not then just go to agra for tajmahal and if possible jaipur to ahve good photography"

Flying in this October. Yuck, Antilla really is a sore to the eyes.  Too much of an edit? Haven't seen water that blue ever in Mumbai. thats Haji Ali right? At first I thought OP was lying,  then I saw the ugly building confirming that it is indeed Mumbai  [removed] That's a beautiful shot. You some politicians kid or something? Because the customs did not allow me to bring my drone into the India, they actually confiscated it. We need more pictures like this! Better resolution please OP Upload this to r/cityporn!  Can you share a higher res pic? Wow. Beautiful. What a shot dude! ❤️ Haji Ali ?  As long as it’s in the check in bag, it shouldn’t be an issue  how did you get the permission to fly the drone there? Have a Phantom Advance with Ton of extras for sale. PM Me if anyone is interested  What is that penis building? Did the pollution and smog disappear entirely or was this a particularly clear evening?

As someone who was in the city last around New Year's, I find it hard to believe that this could have been taken in the same season. Streanh to your drone. Is it called bredater? disgusting place What about the Down photography though?"
Police/Economy,India has announced the least fiscal stimulus (1%) but imposed the strictest policies to counter Covid-19,217,fwm5t0,https://i.redd.it/p9smnamyuer41.jpg,44,1586301064.0,,cncrndctzn2," This is kind of like how middle-class families bring up their children. Extremely strict rules,  high expectations, and harsh punishment  - but few resources to reward kids for following rules and expectations. XD So... To a dumb reader, is this good or bad? Relating to fiscal stimulus part: With the fiscal deficit we already have I doubt our RBI money printer got enough ink to go BRRRR. More importantly I would prefer direct cash assistance to the vulnerable groups as a part of stimulus if any rather than saving our big corporates whose debt is already constipated in our Banks' anus as NPA Think it's still a bit premature. The announced fiscal stimulus is likely to be just part of the overall package. 

Our power hungry politicians will make sure they spend all the countries money on increasing their powerbase once the lockdown is lifted. I was thinking about it quite a bit and my thoughts first of all are -

A) As a growingly educated and constantly informed country, we see people of all different levels of education and standards. I almost feel that we have misplaced standards. Are we truly at a point to compare ourselves with the developed (1st world), about to develop (2nd world) countries? Why are we not looking at Egypt, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa for comparison? Why do we look at economies on an aggregate level and not at a per capita level? After all, the stimulus is going to drive value at the per capital level first (micro economic) before it does anything macroeconomically 

B) Seriously, a lot of these countries have currencies that are the reserve currencies. Usually, these currencies are backed by solid fiscal and monetary policies. These are the currencies that are safe havens. If a country like India spends any further on social welfare, the deficit and therefore devaluation of rupee is pretty much a done deal.

C) Now, not spending the money is also a double whammy. A perfect Keynesian economic storm. Less spending, cut in corporate expenditures, cut in jobs and further less spending and overall shrinkage of economies. Therefore, stringency has to be replaced with prudence and this is exactly where you’d need the finance minister and the RBI governor coming together and becoming true heroes.

D) Keep economy aside, you absolutely need to find ways to ensure that the poor do not become too desperate. The signs of desperation will result in further spread, further law and order situations and overall class divide. This again requires efficiency and effectiveness at the federal and state levels to ensure welfare reaches to the right sections of demographics Demo saga all over again, by the time we assess the impact, Mudi Kaka would win in 2024 while our opposition does jackshit to explain the public what happened to them. South Korea in middle? I thought they had one of the strictest lockdown measures. Rant incoming.

Just for perspective, India's economy is now the 5th largest in the world. You can guess who the top 4 are, but the UK and France are now just below us. Let that sink in.

Forget macro or even micro economics, which is mostly what [the Economist article where this graph is from](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/04/03/emerging-market-lockdowns-match-rich-world-ones-the-handouts-do-not) addresses. 

Think Nano. Urban nano. Or hyper-local urban nano.

The price of life is ""cheap"" here. Inspite of being a mostly young society, we've implicitly decided for example, that the lives of delivery folks (more or less our age) are worth much less that our own.

Never mind their meagre salaries, or that they're starving themselves. Never mind that many of us have not much more money either, but we can always rely on the Bank of Mom & Dad. We always did, and if we didn't before, we certainly will now. They're already concerned about our well-being as is. We're doing what though? Sitting in the comfort of our own homes playing games online or binge watching our shows or whatever; that has implicitly more value than learning how to cook or even making the effort of going down the road to the grocery store. If someone gets beaten, let it be the delivery person. If someone gets infected, let it be them. We're safe. 

This is apart from issues of communal strife, or us not paying our help their fare wages, or the fact that a bunch of us can't be bothered to vote. I could go on.

Infographic of 1% fiscal stimulus on r/India, who here gives a shit. 
Thank you for coming to me TED talk.

End rant. >All countries have spared “essential” goods and services from restrictions. But what counts as essential? India’s list, derived from a law passed in 1955, at first failed to mention feminine-hygiene products, causing confusion.

Where can I get the source for referring law from 1955 to get the list of essentials ? Can you share the source? And yet the andh bhakt middle class of India will call  this masterstroke."

And not at all without any logic. I have sympathy for health workers and doctors and police. And I feel thali bajao and clapping was ok for once (not ok for me). Now lighting torch and all is stupid. I want to convey to the govt and PM that stop fooling people. We are doing the best of lockdown for our own and society's best interests. You are unprepared and unplanned. When you make videos, We want answers on critical issues like:

- what exactly are you doing with PM cares fund? What is the progress?
- what is your plan to provide sufficient PPE kits to medical staff and doctors? By when? 
- what is India's plan to develop cure for covid-19 and by when can we see any outcome?
- what's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as covid-19 is controlled?
- what is the update on scaling up testing of COVID-19 cases?
- China built hospitals within days. Have you done anything like that or alternative to quarantine people?

I know PM wouldn't have exact answers to above questions. It's tough time. But he can atleast provide an update on these more critical questions in his video, rather than just praising public and asking them to do stupid things. Honestly, even I could do that. 

Secondly, this PM has no guts to hold press conference. Even trump is answering to reporters. Then why PM Modi can't? Why he choose to hide and talk from behind the screen only?

That's why I have arrived at my plan to keep lights on and play Bella Ciao. I know the neighbors won't understand what's it and I am safe.

Edit - Note: This plan was originally suggested by another user in a comment in another thread in India subreddit. I am forgetting his username. I and some of my friends are going to follow this plan as of now.

**Play Bella Ciao 5th APR @ 9PM**


Let's not worship our leaders blindly without any logic. Let's have sympathy for healthcare workers and the police who are on the ground risking their lives. Clapping and lighting candles is stupid. The open questions up till now that have not been answered by any govt authority are:

What exactly are you doing with PM cares fund? What is the progress?

What is your plan to provide sufficient PPE kits to medical staff and doctors? By when?

What is India's plan to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 and by when can we see any outcome?

What's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as COVID-19 is controlled?

What is the update on scaling up testing of COVID-19 cases?

China built hospitals within days. Have you done anything like that or alternative to quarantine people?


Our PM has no guts to hold a press conference. Even trump is answering to reporters, then why can't PM Modi?

The whole point of protest is to let the world know what you stand for. Why do you need to hide it from your neighbors? Ye Mera plan chori karta hai

/S Gandia ne ye achha nai kiya . be careful, your neighbours might harass you for that. just like the national anthem brigade I never liked the overhyped activities of our over active pm. Taali bhajao itself was an idiotic action if you ask me. Nicely summed up. I will just go around as everyday. That’s the plan here Am gonna switch off the light coz I want that grid to trip so the entire country will realise whose fault this idiotic stunt was.  

* what exactly are you doing with PM cares fund? What is the progress?

I am planing to hire Tadipar cooperative bank to manage PM cares fund for national security

&#x200B;

* what is your plan to provide sufficient PPE kits to medical staff and doctors? By when?

Jawans are dying in siachen

* what is India's plan to develop cure for covid-19 and by when can we see any outcome?

We are already exporting the cure to USA

* what's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as covid-19 is controlled?

90% of the Indian economy was BLACK, my BJ Pee government cleaned it up.

We will let people die out of starvation but will not allow them to do even one rupee corruption.

* what is the update on scaling up testing of COVID-19 cases?

Tadipar's friend has already stocked up lakhs of test kits, it will cost you a paltry sum of 4500 rupees only

If you love China so much, Go to China

Bharat Mata Ki Jai My plan is to bathe in beer, then get ready to drink whiskey. I got some firework rockets. Gonna shoot that from my 27th floor balcony. Might as well play ""the times they are a-changin"" by Bob Dylan I don't think we should sing Bella Ciao. If you want to sing it, then go on. But I don't know the language, the context and culture of the song is largely alien to me. That is, I am as ignorant as your neighbours and don't feel anything when I hear this song(even if I googled it)  I will prefer a local song. HKSJ as usual. I am not a Bhakt I guess but I am stupid enough to not know get the Bella Ciao song reference. From the TV show community:

> Troy: People have been calling on me for this jacket since I got here, but if I take it off to make em happy, that just makes me weak, right?

> Jeff: It doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them, you keep to piss them off. Either way, it's for them.  That's what's weak.

Your action is still influenced by Modi. #fornairobi Greetings from Italy. I'm wondering why playing an Italian song?

Anyway, what is the situation like in India? i'm very worried about you since your country has a very high density population. I hope you manage to control the virus expansion and to not end up like us. [Their is a hindi version too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJJoVMIQeCw) And it's awesome. My family is not allowing me to keep the lights on. Apparently, ""People will get the wrong idea.""

They are not even letting me post a short message like, ""Please, take it as a gesture. There is nothing to celebrate. Don't turn this into a festival.""

That's how the environment around here is. At sharp 9pm today, I will be doing anything in this world besides partaking in a shameless PR stunt. Heck, that's what I did, except with all the folks lighting diyas on the terrace and me dancing to a tune of a foreign language. People like you are the reason why we can't have nice things.

>Some of them cant even manage their home budget with a huge salary but they want you to manage the economy in these testing times without failures.

*“Again, don’t act like it has happened all of sudden, we had first CoVID-19 positive case in last week of January.”*

>Some of them can't attend their offices or meetings on time and some may not even wake up on time despite alarm clocks but they want you to announce the lockdown in the morning to give them time to hoard and stash the essentials.

*“Now I feel stupid to answer your idiotic statements.”*

>As if and announcement in the morning will have a different impact, silly!

>Their walls are filled with pictures of police charging protesters, even if it was to save their own lives, but their walls shamelessly avoid posting thousands of Indians stuck in the the Middle-East brought back in Air India planes.

*“I know by mentioning the Middle East where you’re subtly pointing out, and I won’t encourage you by replying anything to that. Because admit it, people like you thrive on this.”*

>Their walls are filled with posts on migrants' sufferings but never a single post on what could be the solution to save lives without collateral damage.

>Their walls shamelessly avoid showing Sikhs doing langar, Muslims opening up their hotels to feed the needy, Christians opening their hearts to not just humans but also the suffering dogs on the roads, common men opening kitchens, ordinary people working with government employees to distribute money, goods, food. Don't be surprised why. They don't like you.

>They don't like you because for them you are part of a political party and ideology which they admonish and the fact that you won the a majority in Indian elections twice, which they have neither the capacity nor the maturity to digest.

>Alas, if, and only if, for one moment they could treat you as the head of the nation, head of their nation, the Prime Minister of India... but still, they don't like you.

*“Please go and check his attendance in parliament. And forget that, just check for how many days he was in India in last 6 years.”*

>And Sir, you. You are at fault.

>You don't boast of your government's humongous efforts to be the first one to bring in thousands of Indians back home without even thinking for a second about their race, religion, language, orientation, or even citizenship.

Edit: Added original article link that is going viral.",amzed_can," Have you posted this on Facebook? I want to share this Great work on the replies and the links! I would suggest adding more, and as many as possible (we can help!) so this becomes a sort of mega post with sources that we can share with whoever encourages stupidity and blind worship of the govt. I see that the original article has no links or sources where as you provided sources. That's what these people do they rely on their flimsy opinion as whatsapp needs no sources but to prove them even to people that don't support them they need sources. Anyway great work. The fuck the target post reads like my 6th standard school essay. What shitty level of sycophantic behaviour is this. Isn't this the same article that was posted on rediff ? Who even believes this is written by someone who is not a BJP supporter? I don't even bother getting into an argument with people who post these (which rather sadly was done by atleast 5 people on my timeline who went to premier institutions in the country - all were priveleged upper class Hindus even before I met them during my post grad). I feel like it's impossible to change someone who is well read and still blindly supports everything the government does. The chance that they will turn on BJP at some point of time is the same as me voting for BJP anytime in the future. I wasn't a big fan of Modi (2002 riots) but was hopeful of a sea change in India's development and corruption with the majority they had. 5 years of Modi has all but buried that hope forever. In a country of 1.3 billion people it's a miracle we have a PM that an overwhelming majority would listen to and I would love to be proved wrong about him by the way he leads us through this crisis. Our economy is going to take a while to recover with the US economy already crashing but if we come out of this with competitively less human casualty I would he appreciative of Modi for doing so This is my take from it.

You dont just understand that no matter what steps the government takes, it just cannot fulfiil each and condition you have put up here.

When you have a large, diverse country there will always be short comings and many will latch on to the shortcomings while ignoring anything of substance being done."
Police/Economy,How has this crisis changed/affected you? What have you learned from the situation? Share yourself..,11,fqmusr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fqmusr/how_has_this_crisis_changedaffected_you_what_have/,19,1585440087.0,"This is history in making and tomorrow we shall tell tales of how things happened to our kids like our ancestors did to us.

Things will never be same. Indians are learning basic civic sense, migrants are walking home without food, water, and shelter, millions already lost their jobs, people are dying, economy is a chaos while government pleads us to stay at home with no solid decision to save the future.

I feel helpless. Many were not prepared, many are still not. Elders are struggling with groceries and young are facing the heat from Police.

Some good things are, many are fighting on front lines risking their lives to save us. People are volunteering wherever they can. Influencers are donating and creating awareness.

Wild animals are walking on empty streets and air is cleaner. Less consumption and more carefulness.

One thing for sure, I am never opting for work from ever again.

So tell us your story. How has your perspective changed? How are you coping up? How do you see the future and what's a tip you'd like to share with us?

Yes, India, let's fight this together.",_Floydian," Going to keep a reserve of 1-2 months of groceries, medicines and cash for the rest of my life. I've just learned that there are 40000 workers gathered outside New Delhi RIGHT NOW...2020 is hopeless, also no chicken tandoor for months now (*crying*) For me the most difficult part is to prevent my parents from freaking the fuck out. This is especially proving to be hard since all the messages they receive are practically doomsday death predictions. 

I keep balancing between wanting to be alone(because they drive me crazy) and wanting to take care of them so they don't worry too much.

It's really tough being the 'adult' of the house. I've learnt cooking tho its dope I will survive.

So will lot of us.

Hopefully all.

Those we lose, we will remember.

Society will change, hopefully for better.

This is what I believe...

World will be a better place to live once we mitigate this disaster. When all this gets over, I'm gonna order some stuff and build a post apocalyptic survival kit. Shit just became real.

Thinking of- N95 masks, Sanitizer and handwash, a full spec ppe including goggles, nebulizer, some canned mre type food, flashlight, butane stove, medicines, a small tent (catch me in the Himalayas the next time someone eats a bat soup in China), some veggie seeds, change of clothes, water canteen including purifier, a small solar cell/fuel based generator, 30k cash... etc etc. > I am never opting for work from ever again.

me too... I am eager to go to office again Lost my job ... and in my job it is not possible to work from home.. this sucks.. my resolve to get out of india ASAP has only grown stronger.

Never again will i pay taxes to a government only to then see the most vulnerable in society left helpless. Seriously, shame on this country. I am open to beating the shit out of the police. I am giving up watching cricket. Such a shame that those who are considered Gods are nowhere to be seen. Same with Bollywood, but I was never into it anyway."

Police/Economy,I rant.,17,fl5toc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl5toc/i_rant/,8,1584630787.0,"This is just an expression of my personal opinions; if you disagree, I would like to listen to your opinion as well.

Firstly, I wish everyone good health and safety during this pandemic. Now that the entire country is virtually locked down, protests have stopped, and now is the time for introspection.

* I have a feeling that the protests are aiming at the wrong thing. Yes, the CAA-NPR-NRC is extremely diabolical and dictator-like; yes, it is going to choke an already suffocating Indian economy. But, there is something that the BJP-RSS have successfully diverted attention from. It is extremely unpleasant that this is not receiving the required attention.
* On February 14, 2019, a JeM terrorist rammed an explosive laden truck into a group of CRPF jawans, killing 40 of our dear soldiers. On 26 February, the Indian Government ordered an airstrike on Pakistan, an unprecedented move, in retaliation. The next day, the newspapers reported the Government's claims: the airstrikes purportedly killed 300 terrorists in a ""high-tech and luxurious"" camp, with swimming pools, etc.
* A Reuters report suggested that the airstrikes did nothing; the high-tech camp turned out to be a run down madrasa, the bombings barely damaged the madrasa, and there certainly weren't any ""300"" terrorists. BJP rode to power exploiting an anti-Pakistan emotion and romanticising the Indian Military, something that the Opposition could not oppose the BJP on, considering the election time and the sensitivity.
* Around two months ago, Dy.SP Davinder Singh was caught with terrorists. You just need to search his name up on Google to find out everything. When he was posted in Shopian in 2017, a terrorist attack took place. Worse, he was posted at *Pulwama* when the 14 February attack took place. The manner in which the NIA, headed by Y.C. Modi (who gave a clean chit to the cunt Modi for the 2002 riots), snatched the case from the J&K Police is extremely unsettling, as the J&K Police are capable of taking up such a case, considering the security status of J&K. Furthermore, even on the godi media channels, this issue was toned down heavily, signifying one thing - *the BJP-RSS combine knew about this and worse, they could have planned it.*
* They certainly planned it. They either let the Pulwama attack take place or planned it themselves. The fact that they used the Balakot strikes as an election strategy proves that they didn't chance upon the opportunity - it was months in the making. This is extremely dangerous, because we have two obese cunts with every desire to stay in power - even if it means treason or death. We also know that all the planning is done at Nagpur (RSS HQ) meaning there definitely was RSS's hand in it as well.
* We need to step up our vigil and bring this issue to light. Why haven't we heard an udpate since then? Why is it that even after a year, the govt. is unable to apprehend the Pulwama suspects?Now that our only means is social media, we **must** step up our pressure on the Government. A few ways to do that are: do no argue with RSS trolls on social media, flood the feed with questions, reports, anything you find. Do not waste time or energy retweeting or giving unnecessary attention to bigoted statements of attention-seeking whores.
* Secondly, Shaheen Bagh has to disperse. They cannot stay there, especially during a pandemic. It's a risk to their health and gives an opportunity to stoke hatred for them again. We must appeal to them to disperse; it will be in the interest of the true spirit of the country.
* Thirdly, it is 100% true that the only party that has the capability to oppose the BJP is the Congress. But not with fucking Rahul Gandhi. Let him get another time to prove his shot, not now. Scindia's defection should be an eye-opener. We *have* to pressurise the Congress to purge itself of the Family Power, and even all the politicians who stay only for power. Keep only those who are loyal and ideologically committed. Listen to Tharoor, hold elections for the President. It will take time to reorganise Congress, but there still are 4 years until the next elections.
* This rant is long and tedious to read, but I urge you to pay heed to my two cents. We must remember that we are fighting an ideological enemy, years in the making, disciplined, trained and dreaming for this very moment for years. Protests are good, but we fail to understand one thing: even our protests lack a bit in secularity. True secularism comes from celebrating diversity, not repressing it under the guise of equality and irreligious temper. Through our protests, we must spread literacy, education, upliftment of the Depressed and Marginalised. We need to hit BJP below the belt: its Hindutva agenda that is blatantly upper-caste arrogant and bigoted.

TL:DR - Make Sachin Pilot the head of Congress and Shashi Tharoor in South India. We cannot fight unconstitutionalism with the same breed.",_memelord666," Makes sense. Congress needs major changes. They need to be in action. Every democracy needs a strong opposition. And yes, I agree with the focus on anti-terror activities and how the focus should be there. But with godi media and their presence, i am sure they will somehow make this also work from them. I have seen that happen with yes bank crisis- an issue which should have been one which could have made people look into how the defaulters are these big shots of media and parliament, but no. They just kept talking about the 1-2 crore painting  and the slip by RG in the number of defaulters. But that is just me being skeptical and cynical.  overall, I agree with you. And yes, the protesters need to understand how no issue is worth losing life for. If we are alive, we can continue fighting. [deleted] One thing I have noticed in the recent times, is that toxicity has increased too much people with different political opinions have stopped having discussions with each other, even if they do they get frustrated and start calling each other names and call it a day.

And when you stop having discussions in a democracy well you know the rest."

Lakhs of migrant labourers have been left stranded. They have no way to get back to their villages. They can't stay back. They have no money to feed themselves. They have no option but to head back home by foot as they can at least manage to get some food back in their native place.

This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

This thread is to document this tragedy. Please post any more videos, images or news articles in the comments. I will update the thread.",india_ko_vanakkam," Requesting all to keep this thread updated. We need to keep alive this sincere and serious attempt. Lockdown should have been done giving enough timeframe and means to people to reach their home. Instead it was done almost over night and hence these problems. Chances of homeless migrant workers spreading disease are higher also they have to survive in difficult conditions as mentioned in the post. Modi's incompetence knows no bounds. 

These fucking grand, over the top, bombastic decisions will be our ruin. I'm 100% in favor of a lockdown, but the way this was announced just goes to show how out of touch modi is. For someone who claims to be a ""fakeer"" he doesn't know anything about India's poverty levels it is the govt of the pandit, thanedar, sahukar, zemindar... remember how they hated NREGA"

Check out the responses.

One doctor thinks it's the protestors that are beating up police.

&#x200B;

One architect claims ""The crackdown on anti-CAA and NRC protests is necessary to weed out  illegal immigrants who entered the country and **are the cause of rise in  inflation, economic slowdown and rising crime rates in the country. They  have stalled our progress.** The question of personal freedom does not arise if one understands the government’s policy for passing such bills.""

&#x200B;

One aunty says whatever is good for nation is welcome. Presumably, the underlying assumption is that *everything* government does is ""good for nation"".

People talk about strategies to converse with such people, but it seems their irrationality is way too deep and too widespread to even begin a conversation.",plshelpthedog," My whole gripe with the pro CAA morons are with these educated chutpakodas.

You should keep updating this list, preferably with each item pointing to a news article that summarizes the issue. This could become a nice resource to point a Bhakt towards, they tend to overlook BJP's faults 🙂 [deleted] Sir, you missed one important point.

BJP is looting our RBI and as a result the current CRB ( calamity risk buffer ) is set below 5%. For reference; the CRB of a economically stable and developed country like Canada is 6%.

And if India's heading to a massive economic recession then, sadly, there's no coming back. -	no press conferences
-	 silence on the events of rape, violence, riots, etc
-	 supporting communal Yogi, Pragya and others Have you included...
Vyapam scam? And related suspicious deaths

Justice Loya If bhakt will come here.. and he will not read 69 reasons. He will just say..


Tum pakistan chale jao.. 😄😂 I know few more reasons but I don't want to disturb this magical number. I’m glad that people are finally catching on to Modi’s hypocrisy! 72 - Claims that he only sleeps for 3 hours a day (Canadian Kumar Interview) Pragya's Godse Remarks and Party members hails Godse never accepts him as traitor.

BJP trying to give communal Angle at Murshidabad killing. Several Party members tweeted the images and linked the victim as RSS worker. You forgot to mention love jihad (2014) and cow jihad (2019) Did you target the number 69 or did the count turn out to be 69 at the end when you finished without checking? He is also a pradhansevak of Mukesh Ambani. Creating a surveillance state. NPR will a major step towards that as the moment the data is in silos and not fully connected. But with NPR the citizen will fully transparent to the government. The government will have a 360 degree view of the citizen. This data will then be used to redraw constituencies (as it was done in Telangana) aka gerrymandering to greatly benefit BJP. 

FASTAG - another surveillance tool. The government will now have information about your travel and this will be used to curb dissent. 

Snooping on dissenters, activists and lawyers using Pegasus. 


Data protection bill - gives government immense powers 

Internet intermediary rules - Wikimedia, Github and Mozilla have spoken. It will be death of free and fair internet in India. 

Arbitrary blocking of websites.

Destroying Telecom sector by their favouritism to jio #  It ain't much, but it's honest work

I hope you add links to all the points you've mentioned which act as fact-check for further reference. Modiji, get this straight. The army is not yours. It is not even of any other political party. It is ours. Of the people. None of my friends in the army and my dad, an ex IAF officer, support your divisive politics. He is just of the view that you should allocate them the budget they need and leave em for good unless you want to tell them to start a war. BJP politicising the army by saying that they are giving them due respect has only lowered the military's status and reputation.

Meddling in the politics of Nepal (A strategic ally) and pushed them towards China. 1. I always remember this incident which proves modi has attacked on media. It was sham for democracy when a media was told to have black screen for a day. 

Also the incident where DD news anchor was scraped and rajyasabha tv stopped broadcasting when voices against amit shah were raised

I hope its not too late. Some of those points are arguments for arguments sake.

The BJP has been far better than any other political party in cleaning out corruption so far and mallya etc defrauded the banks under a previous government. The modi government has actually exerted immense pressure to bring them back but they aren't magicians"

The RSS terrorists will come to bait you for your reaction and then the police will magically get activated.

OP: your notes are more valuable than anything. Push them up in your post and embolden important lines.

Folks can join from the beginning or join directly at the collector's office. Whatever you do please don't disturb Railways. It really hurts the people more than the government.

Also they are using *Pegasus* software to plant false evidences.

So, my suggestion is to have some live stream , or video record everything so that when they try to frame you as criminal. +1.

Also, there is no space between a city and a place name in the above list so please edit it and put a space or : Are road transports like buses going to be affected? [This twitter thread](https://twitter.com/manifesthoes/status/1214583650714607621?s=19) gives a good idea as to what is going to change about our country's labor laws. Strike happened? Got nothing to add. Just really impressive. I have so much admiration for the protestors. Damn. One must note this important fact, BJP have the most experience in protests themselves being in opposition for 30 years. So they know what happens during one, so they know how it will happen now. That's how it's simple for them to stop if from happening under their government now. They don't want to feel the same heat they created which previous government felt before.

Bruh. Just say I can't open my shop because I have three other workers and then them gathering here will make us 4 people so we have to shut our shop. Sadly off no effect in Bangalore, Buses will still be open as usual, all works are conducted without leave. People of India, are there many communists in your country? Is this strike being organized by the communist party? We were bullied to shut the offices yesterday morning. They gave 30 minutes for entering attendence and shutting down the systems. Don't see much in Hyderabad. As usual traffic. Buses also are running."
Police/Economy,Why Russia in the Revolution of 1905 is analogous to India today,7,fjkxnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjkxnm/why_russia_in_the_revolution_of_1905_is_analogous/,8,1584394078.0,"Russia in 1905 was controlled by a very hated Tsar. He was in control only because he controlled the police and media. The courts were also controlled by him and thus no real justice was possible. 

Ring a bell? Read on. 

He ruled only for the vested big industry and land owners. They made policies and he simply was their puppet. Farmers were in distress and yes you also had farmer suicide but the Tsar didn't care because his sycophants told him he was the best Tsar ever and that the Economy and people were in great shape?

 Ding ding ding. 

Now in 1904 and 1905 began a series of mass democratic protests, all inorganic and a will of the people. Did the Tsar listen to them? No, he ignored them at best and at worst unleashed his army and police on unarmed masses murdering them by the 1,000's. 

You have made the connection haven't you. 

As this was all making the Tsar look bad, a group of fascists called the Black Hundreds, supported by the police came up. Like the RSS today they were a fascist mob who used the support of the state to silence dissenting voices by violence. Now go read about them and you will see that they mirror the RSS exactly. A summary from Wikipedia. 

>The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, different xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentiment[4] and anti-semitism.

Replace russocentric with Hindutva and anti Ukrainian with Bangladesh and semitism with Islam and you have the exact same Ideology. 

Whenever a peaceful protest came up, these thugs will show up, murder the peace loving protestors while the police turned a blind eye. 

This is exactly the same as India under the Fascist thug Modi.  

I do hope that the people rise up and eventually overthrow him, restoring the rule of democracy we had before him.",Desipornthrowaway," Ding ding

Police/Economy,India’s future.,495,dzg9ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dzg9ph/indias_future/,203,1574353504.0,"With the new statement by Amit Shah that NRC is going to be implemented in the whole country, I have become really concerned about the direction this country is taking. I am sure that this guy is not joking. If he says he wants to implement it, he will implement it. I guess it was a couple of years ago when he said that BJP will be in power for 25 years at least. I chuckled at the time but it seems like that he will be right. BJP has the support of biggest industrialists who seem to get stronger every day. There’s monopolization. 

Economy is pretty bad but the public seems to have absolutely no concern for it.  Even if the nrc comes I am sure no other religion except Muslims will be treated with suspicion. 

And I see absolutely no way that this can be stopped. If the police comes and drags out a Muslim family from their house, I do not see any of the neighbours belonging to majority community coming to protest. All I see is that they come outside, see the show, maybe say some word like “that’s bad”. If the government decides to go full nazi there’s absolutely nothing that can stop them. Not even the international pressure. I used to think my fears were irrational but 370 and Ram Mandir clearly shows these guys are not messing around. I see absolutely no hope for democracy in our beloved country at all. Soon it will just be melancholy stories of a different generation in novels.",mr_ghalib," Shhhhhh... In one and half months we will be a debeloped country. I'm more afraid about the fact that so many people are neutral with the idea of India becoming a Hindu nation. The BJP has been pushing the boundaries of acceptance slowly since they've come to power. The news that I read every day has started to feel normal. At this point, nothing that the government does surprises me. 5 years is all it took to make a relatively peaceful region and turn it into an environment where intolerance and bigotry thrive. The voices of the minorities are stifled, while the majority sit quietly and lets their leaders spew hatred and filth. Have you read the news about Pragya Thakur today? OP couldn't be more right. Majority of people have become more and more dehumanized and I don't see them protesting against any action the govt takes. >when he said that BJP will be in power for 25 years at least.

He said 50 years India has seen darker days, people were literally forced sterilised in camps, almost all of opposition was in jails, Indira was essentially a dictator with even the CJI in her pocket, but India defeated her, do you know why? Indians hate spending money lol that’s the truth, once the economy fully tanks down as it did during Indira’s era ( which was primarily due to wars and droughts) the people will start voting against these sanghis, that, coupled with enhanced regional representation ( which we saw in Karnataka, Maharashtra) along with a tanking economy will bring this government down, but it might not happen till 2028 sadly.

Edit: also one more thing, since the whole narrative of “suppressing Hindu identity” was spun keeping in mind the upper class Brahmins, eventually they will demand reservations on economic basis, but the second the lower classes even get a hint that bjp is gonna do away with class based reservations, the government will topple Very easily, remember the kind of outrage when the SC ST act was amended to prevent arrest without warrant? Yes that. Just close your eyes and say, 'Jai Aryavart!' Nationalism is a curse. I don't understand how Indians can be this fucking blind to see how shit hole the place is becoming. Why can't we learn from history and see the parallels between the rise of dictators/ fascists after ww1 and that between the BJP Yea man it's kinda scary to think of our country's future. Especially I'm very much afraid that one day our democracy might turn to something like Russian Oligarchy (as BJP seems to have support from many industrialists and Rich people). > Not even the international pressure 

The international community will do nichts and look the other way, because they're still thinking Indians is considered and will be for a while as this untapped market and nonsense. See not much outrage on China? It's India, a democracy for what it's worth, and the govt is elected because people wanted them to be there doing these things to them (at least as per the parliamentary democracy that we have). Its depressing but honestly i am not surprised. They exactly know what their Hindi belt voter precisely wants. They are giving their voter what they have promised in elections. Slowly India is becoming Gotham City...

Well atleast Hong Kong already has... My family is shit scared..they are just rambling through the old documents to find proofs, documents, old property papers etc.. Glad my parents kept everything..we have documents before 1947.. although most of them written in Urdu as it was official language of Hyderabad but yeah we got something.. it may not be the case for millions of people.. We the young need to mobilise and protest. The young are their biggest constituents. They will listen. Hong Kong style protests in major cities anyone? > Economy is pretty bad but the public seems to have absolutely no concern for it.

The biggest problem right here. We hate Muslims so much, we're willing to suffer and hurt ourselves for it Oh man , I feel nazi vibes in the air, there needs to be a massive reform in society and the economy.

This path we have been forced to take is frightening tbh. Well in few days we will have to keep supreme leaders photos in our living room as people do in Saudi and Korea. This [statement](https://i.imgur.com/BYSWZIz.jpg) makes me outrageously angry man. Allegedly there are nearly 80 deaths. Now they have realised that it was wrong? What kind of chutiyappa. Opposition parties need to get stronger to oppose BJP. 

If BJP wins 2024 elections, our future is going to be bleak, since the agenda of this whole BJP and RSS types is to turn india into hindu rastra, which means we will never see $5 trillion dollar economy, since for these people their religion is above everything else including humanity and the nation.

To the wave of progress, the wave of hindutva ideology acts as a destructive interference. This is sad. History will remember our generation as the cowards who did nothing against this corrupt and communally polarising government.

I was always under the impression that things will get better with time and there is really nothing to worry about. But with more and more people supporting these goons, there seems to be no hope left. Democracy has failed. Can someone tell me what is the solution? Most indians will ditch BJP as soon as Modi is out.  


You'd be back to usual 'only interested in corruption and filling pocket with money' politicians. I think you forgot to add the citizenship amendment bill. Specifically making sure that a Muslim refugee will not be granted citizenship.

This government is corrupt to the core and the inaction of other parties and general public has made them even stronger.

The majority of the media is owned by BJP sympathizers by now. Further pushing their propaganda to the extreme aham brahmasmi Ohh okay. > If the police comes and drags out a Muslim family from their house, I do not see any of the neighbours belonging to majority community coming to protest

Was there ever anyone come in between when police is taking away someone? Hell, even bystanders won't stop any live crime. Lets get ready for the indian holocaust! I am from a different religion (not a muslim), I am already sure my name is not on NRC

With NRC they can go any lengths when things get worst, like after an economic breakdown and people are in panic, they can use  non NRC people can sweep streets and NRC holders can get top level jobs! wow let the imagination run loose! Imagine the worst, and it will come true! 

\#PhirEkBaarModiSarkar My Muslim friend asked me jokingly “if we will leave india, hope all our house loan and credit card EMI are settled/pardoned” 😂😂😂😂 I don't think we need to worry about industrialists, they will support whoever is in power. The bigger problem is the leadership crisis in the Congress party and the fact that the BJP thinks that something like NRC is worth spending money on when they've already pushed the economy down the drain. And we already have aadhar Congress was much better (before scams happened). There was no demonetization, no GST issues, no Ram mandir talks and no force to get Aadhar to file IT returns. Service tax was 12.36% (now 18% GST) and PPF interest rate at 8.6% (now 7.9%)

I wish Congress puts together and wins over BJP We need a strong opposition I have been telling the people in my family that BJP is the republican paty(US wali) of india. 

some of the similarities :

* Trump gave 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut bjp reduced the corporate tax to 15%(for new companies)

* both parties have a pleothra of nationalist(bhagwa vs white nationalism) leaders that dont know anything other than jai mata di.

* and obviously NRC is the equivalent of the border wall



In fact republicans came to power in the US by changing district lines(gerrymandering) on the basis of big data, and BJP came to power the first time with a team that was extensively using the same techniques at the backend

Frankly India is fucked if bjp comes to power the next time. Thats the truth. Nrc is going to be a super shit show.. And these mad fucks and their groupies will cheer it on till they realise they're next. Well,they want to build 'detention centers' all across country. People who lose their legal rights will have to shift there. This is really horrifying. “Under the spreading chestnut tree
I sold you and you sold me:
There lie they, and here lie we
Under the spreading chestnut tree.”

-George Orwell Alright I understand completely where you are coming from but let me just clear a few things up. 
1. NRC - this was never a bjp initiative. I remember hearing about this even before adhar had been implemented. This was a Congress proposal that has a large scale possibility of being beneficial, and because it would be useful the bjp wants to claim this as theirs.
2. The 370 and ram mandir issue are more complicated than just that bjp Making their 'hindu rastra' bulshit true. These were overdue in one form or the other and bip just could spin them in their favour.
3. About India being another Nazi Germany believe you me that is not going to happen. The same cast/religious/geographical/linguistic divide that hampers the progress is going to make sure that doesn't happen. Simply put a single ideology cannot be universally sustained for a large amount of time in this country. This too shall pass.
I know it seems like the bjp is all powerful and huge now but believe you me that is just a facade the minute cracks start to appear on that image they would loose everything faster than they got any of it.
PS.- if you are worried of NRC then you definitely should search up about ICMS chich cameinto effect in around 2014. It's positively orwellien. Well, I'm gonna try my best and get the fuck out of here and abandon ship. Call me a coward, I don't care, I care about not being fucked over by a fascist state. That's so sad All MLAs and higher up need to clear the IAS/IPS or equivalent exams to serve the nation, change my mind What future? I'm getting the fuck outta this shithole..You should too. Sabkuch changa c  , no problem do u c Sorry I've been out of the loop on this. Can someone tell me the low down on what NRC is(All I found after googling was a Register of/for citizens which doesn't seem that bad) and why it is an issue? I don't trust the Modi Gov or the BJP. And Rahul Gandhi is obviously out of question. This is pathetic. ""Lagta hai barf girne wli hai"" What is NRC? ELI5 Well, systems relative to the NRC are used in most parts of the world. I grew up in Dubai and we had to follow similar laws. We needed to have our documents at hand at all times. Didn't really bother us much tho.

As for 370, wasn't it a strategic necessity? If Kashmir isn't in our control, doesn't India become very vulnerable to foreign forces?

Ram Mandir just made sense. I thought the SC did a good job. Granting land to the Muslims too. I mean, if somebody broke down the Kaaba in Mecca and built over it, I'm sure the house of Saud would have had the Kaaba built up in a jiffy.

But what do I know, maybe the NRC turns out horribly. Much like how 370 has put hundreds of Kashmiris at risk. What is wrong with NRC? 25 years ?? What is the fat man smoking? Or is it the lack of animal proteins that completely hinders his thought process?

I believe that there is a greater chance that India will disintegrate in the coming years ... perhaps even before China. And this not just because of deteriorating communal harmony but mainly because of overpopulation, lack of jobs and reduced individual rights.

If such a scenario does happen, then it will result in the one thing that Caste Hindus and Jains fear...revolt and chaos by the lower classes and other communities. No amount of preaching Ahimsa will help then.Violence and looting will be widespread.

So if the BJP/RSS want to continue to stifle individual rights, create discord among communities and monopolize business for useless shady characters like Ambani/Adani, they should know that they will be looking at the destruction of India and also of their own communities because these people cannot win in the eventuality of a civil war( Historically such types are never seen in the battlefield as can be seen from the funny dandas RSS uses for target practice) Noteable: If you have heard the statement, he said it won't depend on religion and mentioned a bunch of religions except Islam. You think that is how it works? That the police arrives and simply drags an entire family out of their home because they're Muslims? Unpopular opinion here but i think we ll be just fine Ghalib Sahab ki imagination tagdi hai It's saddening but at the same time people will get what they deserve. At the moment, ""India's future"" sounds like an oxymoron. Slippery slope? Has NRC been used like this in Assam? How many Muslim families have been dragged out by the police? I don't understand what is wrong with NRC. Shah said that there will be no bias based on religion. Being Christian myself, I am not worried about NRC especially without any information at this point. Unpopular opinion: i want india to be a Hindu nation. (Maybe I'm biased) NRC is very much needed."
Police/Economy,Cyber Crime,16,ffyr5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyr5b/cyber_crime/,3,1583805518.0,"Today I got a call from a guy, who claimed to be my relative ( my uncle's elder son-in-law, my uncle who only has a son and is in 7th std). By this point of the time, I knew that something is fishy but I played along. Then he said that he is the town to collect money from someone but that person doesn't have much cash and asking to transfer via Gpay or Paytm, so that person will send money to me and my self claimed relative will collect that form me. Then I got a Gpay payment request and that person tried hard to convince me that if I click on Pay then money will be transferred to my account.

My point is if it was someone else at my place who doesn't understand these apps well, he/she could have been easily duped.

Most of the IT companies did start allowing Work from Home (wfh) for a majority of their employees. But some were left out from this under the pretext of essential work for banks such as Wells Fargo. They were forced to work from Office and only after much hue and cry and police raids did they allow the employees to take the desktops home as late as 24th March. This has opened a scope for the spread virus since the virus can still be transmitted amongst employees with out the employee showing any sign.

It has also come to notice that unofficially many employees were threatened of pay cut if they are unable to take the desktops home in spite of 24th Mar lockdown.


The pertinent question arises as to what happens when these employees and their families are found to be infected..? Will they have complete access to health care under company policy? But then, what about their family?

How will they manage their expense if there is mass lay-offs? Given that they are considered too rich to receive ration from govt and too poor to receive grants in the form of bail-outs.

Signs are not encouraging, given that top officials of [corporates](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-25/billionaires-want-people-back-to-work-workers-aren-t-so-sure) (including retired) are not providing encouraging statements (though overseas it will have rippling affect in India) & many companies [like this](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-future-groups-kishore-biyani-in-a-difficult-situation-as-lenders-invoke-shares-report-5070601.html/amp) are already finding excuse of pre-existing loans which signals deferment  of salary pay, for many if not all.

Police/Economy,Bhakts living in India are some of the lowest IQ breed of people,166,ebfwzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ebfwzw/bhakts_living_in_india_are_some_of_the_lowest_iq/,25,1576535863.0,"Imagine living in a country where air pollution is a serious health issue, women safety is a joke and women are burnt just like that, people can't access the Internet because some motu thought so, unemployment is so damn high, economy is going down the drain, you have to stand in line in front of the ATM because a motu said so, the list goes on.

But what are some idiots worried about? Hindu khatre me hai. (Hindu is in danger)

There is a reason I mention bhakts living in India. Because the ones living abroad are enjoying a good lifestyle and standard of living that these doofuses in India can only dream about. They don't even care what happens in the country and why would they. But what are these braindead modi fans who are living in this country thinking?

It hasn't been a month since the horrific Hyderabad gang rape. But the issue is already forgotten because presumably, police shot the accused. So? Now women are safe in this country? So let us start dancing for CAB/CAA. **Were there no hindu guys among the ones who raped them? Are all Hindu saints who would never hurt you in any way? Tomorrow if one of their family members faces such a crime they would probably only want the muslim to be prosecuted** 

Some of these dumbwits mention China and its treatment of Muslims. Fucking LOL. So if a rich successful guy goes to shit on the street I would also shit on the street because that is what the rich guy is doing, and I must do it so that I become rich like him. Are chutiyo, try to go to China someday to see what the difference between India and China is. Their treatment of Muslims didn't make them the country they are now. Are you idiots going to follow the shittest aspects of every country?

Another day I read a comment on reddit saying *2 roti kam kha lenge but vote BJP ko hi denge* which means *Will eat 2 less rotis but would only vote for BJP*

I mean if you care about Modi and Amit Shah so much that you are ready to get screwed then what can I say? I have been living abroad for the past 1 year and the standard of life is amazing here. I know that India doesn't have any future at least not in my lifetime or the lifetime of these bhakts. And this is how majority of Indian population is. There is a reason BJP got a majority. 

Now these bhakts are celebrating things that would have ZERO positive impact on their lives. And after few years they would die. I wish these guys grow some brains.",shinchan_pyara_pyara," There's no dearth of intelligence here. It's a matter of worldview. 

If people could be convinced into sending their Jewish peers to concentration camps, they can be convinced of sending their Muslim peers to detention camps. 

Anti-Semitic propaganda convinced people that Jews were to blame for all their problems, just as VHP/RSS/BJP propaganda has convinced a large part of the population that Muslims are to blame for all their problems today.

It is the same pattern repeating throughout history.

And don't worry, we're not special snowflakes. We just had the opportunity to consume different worldviews than our bhakt brethren. There is no Us versus Them. We're not kids. There is no enemy. IQ is for brain, bhakts have shit. They are one of the mos toxic people I've seen online.They even go one to support lynchers in comment section of new articles. I wish this was true. But the hatred of Muslims has nothing to do with IQ but rather a lack of empathy and deep prejudice. Some of the most intelligent people in this country hate Muslims and are extremely casteist. This hatred has always existed, made worse by partition, and will continue as long as politicians encourage it to get votes. The de-humanizing of the “other” is made easier by our lack of resources and extreme religiosity. What we need is not IQ but empathy and kindness. Average iq of india is 82. The problem with that number is half of the country is below 82 Ones living abroad are even lower IQ people No, no, no don't make that mistake.

Yes, I agree there are people who are ignorant, dumb enough and genuinely think that Hindus are in danger. But that's a tiny minority.

Don't get me wrong, all others KNEW what they were getting. They knew what was coming, at least partially and voted for it. Bakhts of ALL the religions. Some of my colleagues, who are well educated from IITs and in late 30s support shit like CAB. It's nothing to do with IQ it is to do with how much religious freedom they had when growing up. 
When I told them, most of the protest is because of nation wide NRC mulled by the ruling party, they said let people protest when it comes to picture.
People Germany didn't become facist over a night. These scums are not a product of bad IQ, but it is bad EQ. 

That is why you will find bhakts even in IITs and IIMs. The inability to deal with their own insecurities that stems from their bad upbringing causes these bhakts to socially self implode. 



Indian society enforces the child to respect the parents even if they are wrong, even when they become adults. Many Reasons why some intelligent can also be wife beaters, rapists, does corruption and other evil shit. Are you sure they have a low IQ? I mean they voted a facist extremist party to a whopping 300+ majority that warrants 300+ IQ points too right?

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe.",wricker," I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. 
The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be. You should read [this article](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/jyzFxtxjd2iGQPqA3mgOfN/Narendra-Modi-and-the-mystery-of-the-Hindu-Left.html) for more details. 

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones"
Police/Economy,My thoughts on the winning of AAP in Delhi today [11/02/2020] and some other thoughts.,13,f28x1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f28x1b/my_thoughts_on_the_winning_of_aap_in_delhi_today/,2,1581459494.0,"First things first, AAP deserves that huge win considering the condition our country is going through.

Now coming to the issue that was bothering me for a few days that the dirtiest of politics were being played before polling, be it physically or on social media. I am not going to list them here, but it was dirty. 
After polling was finished and the exit polls were clearly indicating an easy win for AAP, BJP ministers were confident that they would win in Delhi. Even before polling Amit Shah had said that the results would be really shocking to some people indicating the party's win. 

This made me bothered that why was this being discussed instead of the BJP's manifesto. Then on Saturday night I got the news that the official numbers for the voter turnout were quite delayed. EVM tampering was coming to my mind. Then when today I saw AAP taking lead throughout, I was honestly relieved that people of Delhi were not swayed by the emotion that Modi plays with. 

I mean if you look from an outsider's perspective, AAP did what a government should do no matter what: improve the current condition and provide. And they did it without talking about religion, Pakistan, the Army, anti-national, Shaheen Bagh, Ram Mandir, Hindutva, Hindu Khatre me hai, Mughals phir aa rahe hain, etc. There is so much hate, I don't know how it came. I mean for hell, we can't live with each other if we know who we support or not support. 

India is 2nd population wise in Muslims. India should concentrate in getting its stake in OIC (Organisation of Islamic Countries) and discuss diplomatic issues. What are we doing instead, ""Musalmaan is desh me badh raha hai to usko hatana chahiye. Hindu khatre me hai"". We are going backwards in that front, honestly. Religion is a private thing between the individual and God. Why make it a political issue?

India is said to be the largest democracy in the world. I felt proud of this statement growing up and hearing it in India and in a global level. But quite sadly, democracy of our country is in danger. Ridiculous things are happening. Law and order is a joke sometimes. I don't care what the students of JNU were doing, a mob came and thrashed them one by one. Police did nothing. Police tear gassed the library in Jamia, broke the mosque, hostel property, etc. No action on anybody except the students. Again students were thrashed before polling day at Jamia by the police. 
Parked cars inside homes and other property of people were destroyed by police in Uttar Pradesh. Is this what you call democracy? Is this good governance? People who question anything become anti-national and if it is a Muslim, he/she becomes a 'Jihadi'. Why? And the other times it becomes the fault of Nehru, or the Congress rule. When the BJP is the government, we will ask the BJP, no? We won't dig up Nehru's grave and question him that why our economy in 2020 sucks.",IzabAhmad," \>  India is 2nd population wise in Muslims.  

My gut feeling says if there were 0 Muslims in India, the Brahmins and Banias will go for each other's throats. And the OBCs vs SC/STs. 

Same game, different players."
Police/Economy,Re: Protesting and Debating with a Bhakt,35,ee2kha,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee2kha/re_protesting_and_debating_with_a_bhakt/,11,1577031268.0,"So trying this in hope of learning and teaching:

1) stick to arguments that you actually won't get wrong footed on. If you make a valid argument but are unable to answer some vague or stupid question, you will be labeled all sorts of things. 

If however, you stick to claims and arguments that you can't be caught out on, then even if they don't listen, they cant get overly defensive. 

For me: those arguments are about The cost and stress. That DeMo was hard for you and people in villaiges didnt even know their notes were invalid. With CAA/NRC it will be worse. Link in the economy. Talk about the 1600Crores required to implement NRC nationwide while there is no money for revamping education in JK, the same region Modi promised to safeguard.


2) Bombard them with verifiable facts. Granted, they may employ mental gymnastics or straight up refute and get defensive. The point is, dont let them plead ignorance like they don't know. Don't let them stay ""apolitical"" when infact they are just manaaoing Bhakti.

3) To people bringing up protestors that weren't sure what the protest was about. Also send them videos of people backing CAA without any clue what they were on about. But more importantly make a compelling argument along the lines of ""People not fully understanding the issue does not, in anyway take away from the argument being made by people that raise their voices in protest."" Maybe even drop in a snide ""just like you thinking its good doesn't take away from my protesting""

4) The violence of protests. Don't try and defend attacks on property. Chances are they wont buy into the ""Police is in Modi's pocket and our targetting muslims"". Tell them that you condemn all violence as that is not what you stand for. But try to point out, through some tweets that I will link below that clearly show that the police isn't some perfect institution either. Show them how any notion that police are saints is false 

5) If they make a point about it only being about muslims being brainwashed and divided into thinking they are targetting. Point out that its a terrible precedent they are setting when they try and put down a minority's protest like that. Tell them a minority doesn't need Hindu support to be valid. Also bring in photos and posters of people of all walks of life(NOT JUST RELIGIONS). Show them students, older people, hindus muslims, foreigners. Show them that it's a nationwide protest and dont let them hide away from images of the sheer numbers. Also bring up the track record of leaders like Adyinath and Saakshi Maharaj

6) as for the argument of majoritarianism, that ""They won seats, they represent us"", point out that it is no excuse. Firstly tell them that BJP won only 37% of LS votes so the notion of them representing the majority of the nation is a lie. Secondly tell them about how it is not an excuse, that even though Trump won, he is still being impeached for being a bad leader. Just because someone is in power, doesnt make them right.


7) Arguments about 'you are protesting and raising slogans. Therefore democracy'.   Let them know this: protests aren't being made thanks to democracy, they are being made despite it being suppressed. Talk about how pro CAA protests are allowed, talk about the usage of tear gas inside hospitals which go against UN sanctions.

8) Any argument about Anti-national. Remind them that people went against Slavery, The British and The Apartheid. Tell them that being against the political or economical powers isn't wrong. Tell them that if it wasn't for those protests we would still have slavery and what not",Transit-Strike," [deleted] Protest in favour of CAA  https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee1o20/hypocrisy_of_section_144_anti_caa_protestors/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share just say - 

1) I refuse to give money, power or platform to any religion or person claiming to speak for religion.

2) This government has destroyed the country and I support protests against it.  

3) Indian police is in urgent need of reform. Anyone who grew up in India knows that and knows what they do.

4) Hindu hoon. @#$\*\* nahin. Wait wait wait. First ask them what the point of pan-India NRC is. Before debating about its efficacy and draconian nature they fail to answer this fully (because the only correct answer is vote bank politics). If they say 'to throw illegals out' ask em for concrete proof about overwhelming proliferation of illegal immigrants across India. Before this don't move on to any other arguments, not even about the blatantly unsecular CAA. In my case, every argument with a Bhakt ends with him/her saying that the Muslims are this and that, and Sultanate and Mughal rule was so ruthless. And I again bombard them with nothing but facts about the Muslim rule. But Islamophobia is real and I'm still at it, debating everyday. I even see some progress in my father. PS: please update me with more My neighbours are going like that it doesn't affect them, they have all the valid papers so they will not oppose this bill. Argue that."
Police/Economy,Do you feel these protests against CAB/NRC will stop BJP from introducing a nation-wide NRC?,53,ebn9nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ebn9nd/do_you_feel_these_protests_against_cabnrc_will/,11,1576568342.0,"I believe, the protests in the North East and ,especially, Assam have hurt the government's image. Especially because the people protesting are not Muslims or just from one University that people do not really connect with. Ironically, the protests are meant for protecting their culture and not for upholding secularism. (In some way, the Jamia protests and police action can be a nice distraction because it helps make this a secularism vs Hindu nationalism debate that the government is quite comfortable with)

As economy has not been doing well, there is already some angst against the government - which essentially changes the lens from which they view things. Economy performing fairly well and the overall positivity of winning the first elections helped BJP survive demonetization. There is no safety-net now. Forcing people to go to government offices to submit proof of citizenship in order to throw out a small proportion of people that most Indians do not even interact with - could be the tipping point. 

Do you think that with worsening economic situation, government will have the appetite for implementing the nation-wide NRC?",Monsultant," Absolutely not , chaos is exactly what they wanted by introducing this bill ..do you see anybody talking about the economy right now .. No. Pan-India NRC will take place. It is one of Motabhai's primary objectives on the road to the establishment of his dream of ""Akhand Bharat"". And frankly, a lot of Indian Hindus support him in this. 

The problem for Modi-Shah at present is that in trying to build the personality cult, they have isolated themselves. Nowadays people ridicule Nirmala as much as they ridicule Pappu, and Smriti Irani will never be taken seriously cuz she was not a RSS *pracharak*, just a TV actress. Stalwart leaders like Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, are gone, and people like Rajnath Singh, Gadkari and Advani have been sidelined. Now they are trying to bring Yogi into the limelight. 


Jharkhand election trends will provide an indication as to what will happen in next UP- Bihar elections. If outrage persists, if protests continue, Taklu will tweak the Citizenship Amendment bill (exclude Assam from its purview, and maybe set 1971 as the cut-off date BEFORE which Muslims entering the country will ALSO be recognised.) I believe  nationwide NRC will be very stupid move by BJP. Average  people do not want unnecessary burden of proving their citizenship. People are still pissed with demonetization,  combine this with inconvenience and chaos  that will be caused by NRC and BJP may very well lose the next election. Ultimately roti kapda aur makaan sabse bada dharm hota h. The NRC is a bid by the BJP to instill self responsibility within citizens.

They did the same thing in demonization. Even though demonization was unsuccessful in eradicating untaxed assets(black money) it did make many believe that they, as an individual, were given an opportunity to help the government in the eradication of black money. This is in contrast to the historical method where the government took responsibility upon itself to address these issues and made the ordinary person powerless."

Me : Hey, see, AAP is doing solid work in healthcare, education. Know what delhi is even running profits after that much subsidies. They are the true ""lighthouse"" party atm. 

Centrist : But you criticized kejri on his stand on 370. Hey know what, kejriwal has a dictator like attitude. There's no democracy in his own party. And also, these freebies are coming from our taxes. Kejriwal is anti free market. You know what,  there has been massive corruption in delhi. Manoj tiwari claimed  ghotala of the order  of 2000 crore, well, they are corrupt too. No, AAP isn't the solution. You know? Most mohalla clinics don't work and its dirty out there

Me : hey, that's political mudslinging brother. Firstly free markets don't work, the education and healthcare always comes at a cost. And for mohalla clinics it has received praise worldwide, ... 

Centrist : so what even kanyashree got unesco recognized in bengal, so mamata is doing good work? (Cutting me midway)

Me : no, not at all, but lets take it this way, in bengal we are left with essentially 2 way fight between tmc and bjp and tmc by far is the lesser evil. 

Centrist : so you support the dhulagarh incident and the burning of buses in these protests and rampant killing of bjp people in panchayat election

Me : friend you are getting me wrong. See, it's a situation that is nuanced and both parties have blood in their hands. If you are to see the medi...

Centrist : no no, you tell me, why are you in favor of burning of buses and trains..(cuts me midway)

Me : well, it was the bjp people there who did it, and can you show me one protest where there was no vandalism of public property?

Centrist : what are you on? So you sympathize with the jamia gang?

Me : do you sympathize with HK?

Centrist : absolutely..

Me : so they were vandalising the parliament and throwing molotovs for protecting their ""basic law""

Centrist : hey but that's a communist govt.

Me : and this is a neo fascist govt

Centrist : what? Like have they killed any one in genocide as of now?

Me : the footprints are more than enough to know where they are going, and for genocide, remember gujarat 2002. And let me ask you, you support CAA NRC right?

Centrist : well, no, not absolutely. But then, they will be removing illegal migrants

Me : what illegal migrants? Like people who can't produce document for up to 3 gens? 

Centrist : but then they will get back citizenship,by normalization route

Me : THATS NOT APPLICABLE FOR ILLEGAL MIGRANTS.

Centrist : I have sympathies, but why are they burning buses, why are they protesting. You can always not agree with it. This is a democracy.

Me : if you are against protest, you must be in favor of the police extremism in UP? Right?

Centrist : Hey, but they were genuine stone pelters. 

Me : cutting him midway... oh really? That's so generous of you to think all of them were pelting stones..

Centrist : see brother, if you protest police will take action.

Me : so what do you want people to do? See 1 crore people become illegal migrants or stateless people and fap on bed. If you are against CAANRC, how many times have you spoken up against it in social media, coz I know you don't have the guts to join a protest

Centrist : brother, am not going to jail by writing seditious stuff. And know what there's plenty of good stuff going on across the country,why just stick on to the protesters

Me : yeah, the only good things are schools, clinics, general populace awakening..

Centrist : so you side with the protesters? You know they are destroying our tax money?

Me : who? Destroying our tax money? Like maybe giving  freebies to corporates, selling public property at dirt cheap prices, raising education fees, destroyed our economy singlehandedly..

Centrist : as I told you brother, there's more to these things than headlines. A lot of it is needed. You know what, all this CAA NRC, this will remove terrorists from the country forever

Me : (losing my cool).. and who took fundings from RKW? Who did malegaon? Who did gujarat? Who killed karkare?

Centrist : you are making arguments like the sickular gang. This protest is all about Bjp v anti bjp.

Me :   ..... bye brother, got some task at hand.",entirepolscience," Too much fence-sitting hurts your arse Absolutely, some bhakts think of themselves as Centrists without even knowing what it means.

Offensive or not they represent the reality. I agree they are over the top and the message has been overlooked by the inflammatory deceptions but nevertheless the government has no right to arrest him. 
This is as bad as blasphemy laws in Pakistan and trampling the voice of dissent.
India is becoming an obscene mix of orwellian, corrupt, plutocratic, capitalistic society with dynastic politics based on caste, religion and populism.  Brilliant. I actually see good in this. Such a knee jerk reaction by the government made up of inept. Let's spread his work.  Quickly everybody! Let's all start singing the Indian national anthem as loud as we can while the statists tell us that India is the world's largest democracy and it has freedom of speech! 

Now, now, children, even though we imprison the people that try to use it to express frustration with with the government and those in power, their desire to expose corruption must be balanced with our national need to not have our feelings hurt.  Forget about the millions who are living in abject poverty, discriminated against by their own government, lied to, stolen from, and made de facto slaves to the state while maintaining the appearance of a free society, our **FEELINGS** and the **DIGNITY AND HONOR** of our national symbols must be protected at all costs even if that means the deaths of millions of children to hunger and disease.

I suggested that we all start singing the national anthem of India because if we start acting patriotic, maybe our government overlords will see fit to allow us to start making fun of them again a little but only in a kindhearted joking manner and not in **ANY WAY** to suggest **CORRUPTION, SCANDAL, DECEPTION, ETC.**

So govt are just following the law. Yes totally abuse the govt now for following the law just because you don't agree with it.

:'( NDTV  is running a story that he insulted anna hazare that's why sent to custody. Complete and utter Misuse of the law I have met asseem trivedi twice. The guy is totally fine. fucking poltician and puppet police.  Y WE NOT FREE IN INDIA? Aseem Trivedi got arrested 'coz he parodied the National Emblem which is punishable by law. This has nothing to do with freedom of speech. Targeting corruption sounds like an understatement. Those cartoons sound inflammatory.  >His cartoons were displayed at the anti-corruption protests led by activist Anna Hazare in Mumbai last December. Trivedi, a freelancer, **sketched 'Mother India' dressed in a tri-colour sari while a politician and a bureaucrat pin her down and urge ""the beast of corruption"" to assault her. The cartoon is called 'gang rape of Mother India'. Another cartoon shows the lions in Ashoka Chakra, the national emblem, replaced with foxes. The motto 'Satyamev Jayate' (truth triumphs) has been replaced with 'Brashtamev Jayate' (corruption triumphs). Another cartoon shows Parliament as a 'national toilet'.**


So we fight corruption by showing rape of women (and that to the one we call 'mother') and insulting national symbols now? 

Yeah fuck freedom of speech if this is how you use it. Just because this shit was shown in Anna's rally doesn't make it right. You aren't any better than Khangress if you  OP, thand rakh."
Police/Economy,Expanding the agenda of the resistance,76,ee3x7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee3x7n/expanding_the_agenda_of_the_resistance/,5,1577042774.0,"It is interesting to  examine the ongoing protests against CAA and NRC in India, in the context of the two other major protests and people's movements in 2019  - Hong Kong and Lebanon. There is a common thread in these 2 protests, which may add an interesting perspective to the protests in India.

Hong Kong protests were triggered by a proposed extradition bill which would have allowed HK citizens to be extradited to mainland China to be tried in their courts, instead of HK courts. The bill was in response to a minor criminal case, wherein an HK citizen could not be tried in mainland for crimes committed there. Despite starting from this limited issue, the protests soon became about the larger question of HK's autonomy and Chinese government's repeated attacks on the autonomy. Similarly, protests in Lebanon were triggered because of a proposed tax on whatsapp calls, and yet they soon morphed into protests about the mishandling of the Lebanese economy by the government.

The distinctive pattern is clear - there were tensions and resentments among the people, but they were under the surface. A related move by the government triggered protests, which provided an outlet for all the built up tensions and resentments. Soon, the protest became about something much bigger than what triggered it - protecting sovereign, democratic institutions in the case of HK, and questioning government on the state and plight of the economy in Lebanon.

If you look closely at the protests in India, you start to notice a similar pattern. The trigger is of course the CAA and proposed NRC, which threaten the constitutional principle of secularism. But resentment about this government's attacks on constitutional values and institutions has been building up for years - SC judges came out in protests first time in the history of India, autonomous institutions like election commission and RBI have been weakened and hijacked, Universities have been attacked, their autonomy snatched, financing cut, ideological appointments made.

Economic mismanagement is another issue which has created widespread resentment over years - Demonetization was a historical blunder which devastated the economy, GST was poorly implemented, small and medium enterprises were worst affected, unemployment is at a 50 years peak, GDP growth is lowest since liberalization, ILFS and PMC have collapsed, many other large institutions and companies are on the verge of bankruptcy. Two RBI governors, chief economic advisor and Chair of Niti Aayog have resigned to protest the mishandling of the economy.

Another issue is the disintegrating social fabric of the country and increasing violence in all walks of life - lynchings, sexual violence, police brutality, caste atrocities, etc. Even in the case of these protests, the situation escalated only after the excessive use of force in Jamia despite no evidence that students were involved in acts of vandalism and arson. The violence continues to grow as more than 20 people are dead in last week, and Yogi swears revenge and carries out extra judicial killings and arrests.

Therefore, we must drive the protests forward towards the logical next step, which is broadbasing them to larger issues (CAA being one of them):

1. Attack on Constitutional values and institutions
2. Mismanagement and devastation of economy
3. Increasing violence in the society",hsnaras," You need to add the most important reason:

Threatening citizens of this country and demonizing them simply for asking questions or criticizing 'you know who'. Even the Chinese government had to back down from their bill. Question is what will BJP do here? At this point it looks like a wait game, the government just wants to ignore and suppress the people until they grow tired. you guys should know that -

&#x200B;

1. Amazon when it wanted to take over retail in america, lobbied local city and state governments to make more laws and compliances needed to operate a small business. By this increase of the complexity of paperwork required, small business were at a disadvantage compared to large corporations with armies of lawyers.

This is the reason behind the seemingly ""business unfriendly policies"" that we are seeing. Small and local businesses are being driven out. Hitler was fueled by the siemens/ ibm / vw / thysenn etc corporates. These people do not exist or work in a vaccum. The red indian genocide or East India company bengal genocide wasnt due to blood lust, but by european capital aggressively pushing their interests and using all tools at their disposal.

&#x200B;

Usually, these days a fringe / lunatic group is found, and by leveraging global money, military, blackops, media, IT and internet manipulation, that group gets a huge competitive advantage in the polls, and sweeps to power. Its opponents are like peasants or redindians fighting against modern tanks and drones. 

&#x200B;

In return, the lunatic group has to sell everything that is asked to the same players who helped him win. This is why you demonetize, you do a crazy GST and you keep fiddling and tinkering with laws, so that local businesses give up and the country gets controlled by the global behemoths.

&#x200B;

You become a nation that sells its labour and raw material at the rates dictated and your market is taken over, your industries destroyed and your local economy and manufacturing base finished off."
Police/Economy,"Opinion- The Govt was hoping to divert the citizens’ attention from it’s failings, but that has backfired terribly for them.",32,ebrnmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ebrnmi/opinion_the_govt_was_hoping_to_divert_the/,6,1576590171.0,"I feel like by introducing CAA, the government was planning to shift our focus from key issues in the country today- the terrible economy, countless rape cases, Internet bans across India, the continuing subjugation of Kashmir etc. 

But in my opinion the nationwide protests suggest that we haven’t overlooked those issues for the immediate CAA+NRC and police misconduct protests, but this incident is being viewed in context of all those other instances during which we were relatively quiet.
The people are recognising the fascism this government brings to our nation, and that has brought so many of them on the streets.",FerzemKhan," But sadly it's highly unlikely that bjp will loose even if there is an election right now. The govt should accept tha fact that Indian citizens are not fools. And sooner or later the governments failure in all the domains would result in public anger in one way or another. May not matter in the end.

Right Wing is reveling in this, showing off the protests as by anti nationals. The Jamia violence is being pinned on Muslim students, and Muslim locals (the last ones seem to be responsible anyway). Bengal violence,  stereotypical Muslims are being blamed for. The ones who the PM pointed to.

The entire thing might serve to consolidate the Modi votebank. I don't think it has backfired on BJP..for them the end goal is to dehumanizing Muslims..so the part one of the plan was to push them to do protest..when protest happen shit goes down..now part two is to use that shit in the election.. It's working just fine"

At the same time I am 💯 percent sure that the BJP is going to move forward and implement this in whole india. Because if they take this back then people will soon realise their power over government, which I don't think a control freak such as our PM will ever want. There are going to be nation wide protests soon And what did the NE do when other states were in crisis? The only reason Assam deserve CAB is, just like the rest of NE, they voted for BJP too.

Police/Economy,Challenges to Hindutva's new avatar,9,elbleg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/elbleg/challenges_to_hindutvas_new_avatar/,3,1578432747.0,"The weakening of intra-party democracy can adversely affect the BJP’s strength on the ground, as it discovered in Jharkhand

For the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), most of 2019 was a good year for its Hindutva politics. It won a general election using its majoritarian card; it swiftly enacted the Triple Talaq Act, diluted Article 370 in Kashmir and pushed through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), even as the Supreme Court ruled in favour of a Ram Temple. The stage appeared set for the continued growth of the BJP and its ideology.

And then, countrywide protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) began: young people, women of all ages — and of all religious denominations — gathered on the streets. Even harsh police action failed to deter the protesters: the people had finally decided to fight back.
Disillusionment with BJP

The beginning of disillusionment with the BJP is visible. The party’s performance in successive general elections in 2014 and 2019 were stellar, but its footprint in the States is shrinking, most recently after its defeat in Jharkhand. There are signs that the economic slowdown is hurting people. And, the spectacle on Sunday night of the police standing mute as vandals ransacked Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and attacked students and faculty members, has just added fuel to the fire already raging in universities across the country.

The BJP’s top leadership has been largely silent on these issues. Party spokespersons have distanced Mr. Modi from the reverses in Jharkhand stressing that but for him, the party would have fared even worse.

On the economy, the government has been in denial, with some suggestion that the downturn will be addressed in the Union Budget on February 1. As for the anti-CAA/NRC protests, the government has chosen not to engage the students in a dialogue; instead, the party has sponsored counter-demonstrations, the assessment being that the agitation will fizzle out.

The BJP’s recent poor performance in State elections underscores for the party, the dangers of concentrating power in the hands of one man, and the urgent need to build powerful State leaders. The disinclination to face squarely the economic slowdown, the agricultural crisis and the failure to create jobs received an answer in Jharkhand: charisma, rhetoric and slogans do not work beyond a point. Finally, a government that stops listening to its citizens, as it is doing with the protests, is one that might find, in turn, that it is not being heard.

Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah have also ensured that most party functionaries, including Working President J.P. Nadda (to be elevated as president by end-January), are reduced to ciphers.

Most of the post-2014 Assembly elections also point to the marginalisation of State leaders and the browbeating of allies. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani returned to power, but with a considerably reduced majority. In Haryana, the BJP under Manohar Lal Khattar emerged as the single-largest party, but needed the Jannayak Janta Party’s help to form a government; in Maharashtra, the BJP’s failure to accommodate ally Shiv Sena cost it its government.

Plucked out of obscurity and made Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Haryana, Mr. Khattar and Devendra Fadnavis did not have a national profile. Today, five years later, they are still “mere pawns on a chessboard”, as a Sangh insider put it, a far cry from Mr. Modi’s status in the Vajpayee era. In April 2002, Mr. Modi mobilised an influential section of the party at the Goa National Executive meeting, upstaged Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who wanted to sack him for his role in the communal violence in Gujarat earlier that year, and went on to win three consecutive State elections. In 2014, he became Prime Minister.

Others in the BJP’s earlier crop of Chief Ministers, starting in the 1990s, were not as successful as Mr. Modi. But they had spent years working their way up the ladder, and had built reputations of their own. Take Kalyan Singh in Uttar Pradesh; Shanta Kumar in Himachal Pradesh; Sushma Swaraj in Delhi; Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Madhya Pradesh; or B.S. Yediyurappa in Karnataka — they were all important personalities in their own right. Some, like Mr. Kalyan Singh, Mr. Shanta Kumar and Mr. Yediyurappa showed their capacity, when cornered, to even challenge the central leadership.

Compare the leaders created in the Vajpayee-Advani era — when inner-party democracy existed, if not flourished — with the second crop of yes-men Chief Ministers, with only Yogi Adityanath not fitting the pattern.

Today, the BJP is beginning to resemble the Congress of the early 1970s, when Indira Gandhi, after the liberation of Bangladesh, was at the height of her powers. She had no time for dissenters in her party, nor did she brook any challenges. If the Congress power structure depended on regional leaders building their bases, she began the process of weakening them.

Learning from the Congress

The BJP leadership would do well to take a lesson from the Congress story. Weakening inner-party democracy and reducing regional leaders to nonentities can adversely affect the party’s strength on the ground while boosting regional outfits — look at the Shiv Sena and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) today.

Today, the BJP’s efforts to crush democracy in the country is a mirror image of what is happening within the party. Indira Gandhi’s Emergency demonstrated that ultimately, the people will revolt; and party men will abandon you.

That is unless Mr. Modi believes that his majoritarian politics will ensure that 2024 is a shoo-in. But if Hindutva is allowed to have free reign, it will destroy India as we know it. It is time the Opposition got its act together. The people have already shown their willingness to join the fight — they now need leadership.

It's not on the map, there is no mention of the place online before this incident ever occurred. The nearest police station,  Dumbriguda, lies between Araku Valley and Odisha border. This is near epicenter of Andhra's Maoist territories. Infrastructure is limited, many villages probably do not have teachers or doctors who regularly come in. These places have been viewed as unimportant to government for decades, and if there is no natural resource, there is no investment in development. 

You cannot excuse the crime, but the ignorance and lack of policing which lets it occur is because people do not have outside perspective. Centre does not give two fucks about people living in places like Puttabandha, except when some Maoist attack happens or when villagers do something crazy and city people can sit back and say, 'these adivasis are living in a different century, it like Salem witch trials.' 

people either must stay in the village and remain ignorant, or they go to Vizag or Kolkata or Hyderabad and do hard labour for a few rupees per day."

I know nothing will and could happen regarding all of this, The govt. have absolute power. But people atleast should know.

Edit : few spellings and sources.",rig_vedic_sage," People should know indeed. Up-voting for visibility. Don't know if it will reach hot. No one? No one's gonna say it?

Ok, I'll say it then.

These are actual, planned conspiracies through which selectively targeted people are silenced by the powers-that-be. The moment I read this news i sensed that something was wrong The whole thing is so bizzare! Even the suicide notes has two different stiles of writing on two different pages telling two different stories. You know you could also ""commit"" suicide after writing this?

PS -  Upvote this so it can reach hot, maybe r/all Rampage corruption lol. The grammar in this so called "" suicide note "" is bad af. Jokes apart, UPA and Chidamabaram were in power during the recession of 2008 and we weren't that badly affected then. And this guy is seriously criticizing Chidamabaram consulting a lawyer?? So what does he want him to do? Go to the court without any prep cause somehow innocent people dont need lawyers at all and justice always wins ? This is the 5th news from UP since yesterday what is happening with the govt, people, activities there at this point I don't know what to feel scared about 

I should feel scared about UP or feel scared for UP Okay, this is a wild theory, but is it possible that this IAF officer was actually providing an adversary with confidential information and the government used a hit job to milk propaganda points? Especially since Chidambaram is in custody and the government wants to keep him there.

Or maybe the BJP made him an offer he couldn't refuse - especially that bit about taking care of his kid.

Don't officers of Wing Commander rank make a good amount of money as far as government salaries go? Isn't anyone going to mention the insane number of grammar mistakes considering this was written by an 'IAF Officer'?

Edit: Spelling I dont know about the rest, but my guess for the latest IAF suicide would be, the guy actually committed suicide for personal reasons, when the police or whoever responded at the first instance saw an opportunity, and some overzealous ""babu"" or cop eager to proove his loyalty to the government or get in their good books, actually wrote this fake ass letter and removed the original one(if there was one in the first place).

But the Judge Loya thing is a true mystery. I hope one day they catch the murders. [removed] Good read > 'conspiracy of modi's assassination'

this used to be used on a monthly basis in gujarat to justify encounter killings when modi was CM. a large number of people have been killed using this excuse. RIP u/rig_vedic_sage..... >Conspiring to assassinate PM is a big crime, it's very odd that the case wasn't given to RAW/CBI/IB , it was under pune police.

Raw or IB are intelligence agencies they do not deal with local investigation .Their  primary  task is to gather intelligence and pass on . Sometimes covert ops are carried by them but thats too rare .The jurisdiction of pune police is right . CBI cant just pick up an case they need court order for that Fucking finally!!! Thank you for saying this! I used to say all this to a lot of people, and I was always told to shut up cause I didn't know what these ""great"" people have done for our country. Anytime I even raised a doubt about validity of the ""facts"" being spewed by these imbeciles, I was called an anti-National. This economic slowdown may be bad, but it atleast had the effect of making critics be heard a bit more. There's a saying that is roughly if something fucked up has occurred it is almost always caused by incompetency and not bad intentions. In India I think the reverse is true. Every fucked up thing you see is because somebody is profiting from it. Conspiracies aren't that far fetched in India. Sometimes things are just as they seem. 

The retired officer committed suicide for personal and financial reasons. And since he was going, wrote a stupid letter. No need to look too much into it. 

The other IAF wing commander most likely killed himself for personal reasons. Unless we have any other info we shouldn't be doing conspiracy theories. Talking about letters you should read Arunachal Pradesh' s (I think) ex cm suicide letter.

They unblocked the networks just after midnight here. I'm in a small town so I hardly know what has happened for the past few days since the blackout. There has been heavy police presence here without any sign of protests let alone riots/violence. All the schools, etc are closed. Businesses are barely open, people are really struggling. I was wondering how long they would keep this going before it has a massive impact on the economy.

Also, any tips and advice on what to do if they block the internet again? Any way to find out when they will be blocking the internet beforehand? Anyone in the same area here?",DigBickering," It has already had a massive impact. There was a reply of sorts by the PM.

The violence yesterday at JNU - as the police stood by and let it happen- is unbelievably tragic and heartbreaking.

Last 6 months have been really dark days for our democracy. Between the authoritarian decision to scrap Article 370 without any consultation from Kashmiri leaders or population; the rampant Internet shutdowns and Article 144 evocations; CAA/NRC and the police brutality against minorities; and the disastrous state of our economy, I think our Government has crossed a line.

I can no longer give them the benefit of doubt. We all stood by and let an asinine policy like demonetization happen, thinking it was just a misguided Government working for the greater good. We didn't even flinch as administration took no action against increasing communal violence, and recruited criminals and openly communal leaders. But it's not a time to remain apolitical anymore.

At this point, I firmly believe Government has run out of chances. If we continue to support it and do not protest against the blatantly unjust laws, we are looking at irreversible damage to our social fabric. The economy is already in a pretty bad state by nearly every metric except the top 20 companies. 

I implore upon everyone still reading this post to think about everything that has happened under our Government. I don't believe in telling anyone to support a particular person or party, but I urge everyone to give a long hard look if they voted for our ruling party. The ongoing protests and everyone raising voices against these laws make me believe that we can still survive this, and come out stronger. I hope we are able to.",ABrightPlace,

This is a very good initiative and deserves appreciation. 

Some suggestion:

- The current format brings attention but is not suitable to stimulate a discussion because of the wide variety of topics listed. Reddit works because each thread is about one topic (roughly put), and it attracts those who are interested in discussing that particular subject. 

- Instead of collecting everything in one single thread, I'd rather that the mods split them by topics into separate threads. 

- Personally, I feel the ""community policing"" model of reddit in general is failing because of vote manipulation by vested interests. (This initiative is a good example for this). 

- As such, I feel the mods here should be bolder - don't just help with the policing of the community but be more active contributors by becoming editors (or nominate or elect members from the community to be ""editors"").

- The task of of the ""editor"" should be as it is in any modern publication or media outlet - sift though the 100's or thousands of moderated content submitted everyday and highlight content that the r/india community should be more aware of, discuss and debate. 

- For this, the mods shouldn't be afraid to have more than 2 sticky threads on the front page. (In fact, personally I'd be comfortable with up to 5-6 stickies every day.)

- Thus stickies by community ""editors"" and the generally community contributed upvoted / debated content on the front page should make things more interesting here and also help more in creating harder to manipulate community with better content.

------------

Edit: On more thought, a simpler approach initially, could be to link to the relevant topic threads  here directly instead of linking to the news sources directly. While it would mean we have to click twice to read an article, but it would also stimulate discussion on the topic and address part of the problem I originally highlighted. [Pakistani PM: India's crackdown on Kashmir will spur global Muslim extremism](http://www.tersbakis.com/news/14905/pakistani-pm-indias-crackdown-on-kashmir-will-spur-global-muslim-extremism/) Thackeray family traces origin to Bihar, says new book Detention Centres, Rounding up Urban Naxals and taking people's rights in the name of national security.

Police/Economy,A quick shoutout to these protestors.,31,eca6rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eca6rt/a_quick_shoutout_to_these_protestors/,1,1576688579.0,"I'd like to start by saying a massive shoutout to students across India. It's fairly intriguing to see conservative, islamophobic adults being shown a side to student's I doubt they'd have expected to have seen. Indian students from across the globe have gotten up and raised their voice. It's not just ""one of those petty protests"", it's the youth standing up for their own, who have been wronged. Wronged might even be too kind a term, if you take into consideration the sort of trauma students and their parents from JMI would have had to go through (And still are). Yet it's not just JMI vs the government, it's a collective of intellectuals who can see the bigger picture this government is trying to create. I recently had a conversation with an accomplished advocate, who made several very questionable statements:

\- why don't people protest when Hindu's are being ill-treated around the world?

\- Why are the student's so bothered by this, are they ""vela"", why don't they study? none of this will directly affect them.

\-  The students have been violent, it's their fault.

\- These protests are nothing more than an inconvenience to people and their daily lives.

\- Muslims have never been discriminated against.

\- The Secular in the preamble of our constitution is just for show, India has never been secular.

\- Your fight is with Amit Shah and not Modi.

\- Modi has never done anything to Muslims, so what if he promotes Hinduism, he's executing his right to religion.

\- All of these stupid protests are taking away from Kashmir and Assam.

\- Fake news is what you Educated Illiterates thrive on.

\- My tax-paying money is being wasted on this.

&#x200B;

This, I repeat, is coming from an accomplished and successful advocate.

Allow me to break these statement's down to show you what's inherently wrong with them:

\- The reason people haven't protested like this when Hindu's are being Ill-treated is simply because people didn't care. If it mattered to you. You would have stood up for it. To put it simply, this is your  ""All Lives Matter"" to our ""Black Lives Matter"". 

\- The students are bothered by this because it was an unprovoked attack on JMU. People protest all over the world. Students protest all over the world, I don't see police all over beating up these students, jailing them and refusing them lawyers (sounds vaguely unconstitutional to me.)

\- Firstly, what the advocate was referring to was the bus being burnt, which was later revealed to be the police doing it themselves. This was before the situation in Seelampur, which many students have condemned. An interesting point I had seen was raised by Trisha Shetty, ""the questions of civility, of politeness appropriateness of conduct are never asked to those committing Human wrongs, only those who are fighting for human rights."" ""Be polite to those oppressing you? when the people on the front line, who have been marginalised, don't have the privilege of being polite.""

\- Protests are supposed to be inconvenient, it's only when protests stop the daily working of life in this country that the government feels the need to even pay attention to it. Listening to it and understanding the concerns, however, is something that's yet to be found out. In time's of emergencies, in the case of ambulances, the crowd disperses allowing the vehicle safe passage. 

\- The lesser said about this point coming from a member of the judicial sector of our country, the better.

\- Read the point above, it should suffice. In any case, even if it hasn't been a thing, it's still something to strive to, not forget.

\- Our fight is with all of them, screw your politics and all your leaders when they decide on if an individual's life within a nation is dependent on their religion.

\- His right to religion overrules no one else's . He's an elected candidate. Voted in by all religions, not just the Hindu's and as a government servant, his role is supposed to be for all his people. Again, the lesser said about him never having done any wrong to Muslims, the better.

\- These protests don't take away, the media owned by the government would never showcase the Assamese and Kashmiri problem ( and even if they do, never the complete truth). I don't think anyone is unaware of how these states have been cut-off and their voices are going unheard. In the meantime, with the voices that can be heard, allow them to scream and inconvenience your nation loving government. 

\- Fake news has and will always exist, unfortunately on both sides. However, looking at real accounts of students within their campus. Hearing from people actually at the protest counts a lot more than any of your fat politicians sitting on their twitter account with what I'd very politically incorrectly term, Uneducated literates. 

\- You're only bothered by it because you don't like it. It didn't matter when they made your Statue of Unity promising it to boost our tourism economy and overall growth. But a Government failing to deliver on promises, hm feels like I've seen that somewhere.


To all the student's and Adult's protesting, I love you more than anything else. Please take care of yourselves and one another. The very police who promised to protect you have shown that they work on their paycheck and not on their conscience and who can blame them when they get paid peanuts.

These manifestos are mostly made by the respective parties in consultation with their party heads, which as everyone knows are filthy rich people, and who are most often disillusioned by the pains of the poor and masses. Hence, I do not understand why they fight an election on (false) promises they find suitable to make to us.

Instead, they should ask the common man, what to implement and what not to. But since that is not going to happen IMO, we should instead make a manifesto and ask them to fulfil our needs.

I have prepared a mini-manifesto by myself. I am a middle-middle class guy, so I may not be correct about the needs of some other classes like BPL, Lower-middle class or Upper-middle class. I may have also missed on some points and may have written less on some particular topic, kindly excuse as this is done by a single person only.

I have not written much in detail, specifically about Jobs and Economy as I am yet learning more about these fields. But IMO the points I have already mentioned will help in bettering both somehow.

Also, it may seem to some that I have proposed establishing/purchasing a lot of things, and it may seem like a drain on the economy. But IMO those are some basic necessities for the much-touted Super Power, which itself is a welfare state, to begin with.

One more thing I want to address is that I staunchly believe in HIGHER TAXES for Billionaires and Millionaires. As Bernie Sanders says, ""Billionaires should NOT exist"" when half of the population finds it hard to put two fulfilling meals on the table.

Further commenting on above, I believe all natural resources on earth belong equally to each human, and not only to the ones 'privileged' enough to reap monetary gains out of it. I think no one will disagree that a Billionaire doesn't work more than an employee of his/her company. He/she just happened to make money by making others work for him.

And from the little economics I have read, even these rich people need poor, middle-class people to buy their stuff. If the current trend continues, poor will not be able to afford their products which will eventually end up lowering these billionaires wealth. And all the people advocating for Capitalism, kindly look at the USA. Capitalism has sucked it hollow. Millions do not have homes, they sleep in their cars. They survive on food stamps and pay $2500 to deliver a baby. Student debt is at an all-time high. Rich are getting richer, true but for how long you should ask.

Police/Economy,How is life different for an Indian in USA compared to India.,67,c7dum7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c7dum7/how_is_life_different_for_an_indian_in_usa/,52,1561930349.0,"I had a discussion with my brother who's obsessed with USA just like every other Indian dreaming to live the American dream. I told him its not great based on what I see on reddit. 

My argument points were: 1)Healthcare is really expensive,2) Indians will always considered  second rate citizens,3) economy does not favor the lower and middle class and makes it much harder to sustain a family of 4 than what it will be in India,4) legal problems and police matters siphon away time and energy more than what it will cost in india,5) the quality of life that everyone dreams of costs a lot of money in the name of taxes, 6)you will never be able to enjoy life like a white American and that's just true.7) everything from starting a business to buying groceries is more expensive than what it cost for the same thing in India.

He gave me his reasons why he thinks USA is the best country to live in and  why I'm wrong:1) the country has a better constitution and protects the citizens much better than Indian constitution, 1) police actually helps people instead of extorting them and isn't corrupt like indian police, 2) citizens get a fair chance at life and if they are talented they can get successful unlike india where even talented people can never make it big even if they tried, 3) no nepotism and people aspire to make a name for themselves unlike india where actor's son is actor , politicians son is politician, doctors son is doctor,etc.4) much much better climate and no pollution, cleanliness and sanitation are actually a priority unlike india where its a political stance to get votes and publicity. 5) life is easier compared to india and if you're any bit competent you can make a living. 

Now we're both thet Desis and have never been outside even our state let alone the country and all that we know about any country is through internet. If anyone who's lived in USA or currently lives in USA is reading this tell me who is more wrong me or my brother.",MGsquare," Life in US has its own share of problems. Subtle racism, crime and drug issues (some areas in cities are labeled as “seedy areas”), healthcare costs if you don’t have proper insurance. Unless you are a Green card holder or a citizen, you have no safety net. Depending on where you stay, you could have a support system or be living and feel completely alienated. 

But the advantages are lesser population, lesser pollution and social freedom (ie novody gives a fuck about your life choices). They value individualism a lot, so if you are a hard working person with strong work ethic, you can definitely be appreciated and rise in corporate circles. 

Every situation is not black and white. You and your brother both have valid points. As a white American, I don't want to comment too much on the Indian side. But I'm close with a lot of people who have moved here from India (gf and several best friends are Indian, call a lot of their parents aunty and uncle, etc.) and I'll make a few rough suggestions.

My tl;dr: It's probably a bad idea to move here unless you have a job offer or a solid plan to earn at least $60k-$70k a year, or are accepted to a very reputable university for a program that you can afford. But if you do meet those criteria, most people seem to enjoy it.

1. Health care is less problematic than it used to be - my sister had an entire pregnancy and multiple surgeries with no bills whatsoever because she had coverage through a government program. But you do need to have a plan for how you will get health coverage, either through your job or budgeting for it.
2. This depends a lot on where in the US you move and your social circle. You will likely have some experiences with subtle racism, especially if you have a noticeable accent (which anyone coming directly from India almost certainly would). But the process for becoming a permanent resident and a citizen is generally fair and transparent, and for the most part you should enjoy the same rights as anyone else. There is, however, less of a safety net for you if you suffer economic hardship, especially in your first several years after moving.
3. This is an extremely complex question. The economy does not favor the lower class at all. I do not recommend moving here to be working class. Some people make it work for them, eventually saving up enough to start their own business and succeed, and there are many success stories of Indian hotel owners and gas station owners who started from nothing and now have all their children achieving the highest levels of success. But they work unbelievably hard to achieve that and usually seem to have significant help from their extended family to get going. I could not do it that way, and if it were that easy, everyone here would do it.

3.5 For the middle class, it depends on your definition of middle class and the area where you live. The Bay Area is a terrible place to be middle class, but there are many great areas of the country where a single guy can have a wonderful living on an ordinary middle class salary. However, if you want to get married and have children, you probably want to break into the upper middle class or have a spouse who also has a middle class job.

4.  While there are excessive use of force incidents with US police regularly across the country, the average person doesn't regularly encounter much in the form of legal trouble resulting in any payment or whatever. The last time I had a ticket I just spoke to a magistrate and got it dismissed with one trip downtown, and that was 7 years ago.

5. While we do have taxes, they are pretty low overall for a developed country. But it depends on what quality of life, exactly, you are dreaming of. Because domestic help and childcare are really expensive, it's much easier for single people to afford a great quality of life than for married couples. You will almost certainly not have house servants to the degree most reasonably well-off families have in India - my parents are pretty well off, definitely top quintile of US income, and the most they have is a lady who comes in and cleans the house once a week.

6. I don't know if this is true. A lot of Indians seem to really enjoy their life here. My girlfriend has zero interest in moving back, even after I said I would be interested in trying out India. I do think that Indians who have an individualistic streak and feel stifled either by their family or by the cultural environment in India tend to like it the most here, because no one will be in your business unless you choose to invite them in. There are Indians at the top of basically every career field now here.

7. Yes, everything is more expensive and you need to keep US salaries in the perspective of US cost of living, especially if you are going to move to a hyper-expensive area like the Bay Area or Manhattan. But starting a business might be easier and less expensive, depending on the kind of business and how regulated the sector is. Many forms of business in the US can be started with extremely minimal paperwork, fees, and no approval process.

And finally - I have a lot of disagreements with my country's government and our culture and the way we do things, but ultimately I have stayed here and will continue to stay for the near future because now that I have finished my education I am going to work on improving it. I think the best reason to either not worry about coming to the US or only wanting to stay for a while is because what you ultimately want to improve India, which is a pretty awesome place where 1.3 billion people are currently living. If you decide you don't want to come for that reason, I won't take it personally. So I was born in India and reside in the US right now. I was in India until 9ish and then moved to the US. Even though the process took such a long time, I’m a naturalized citizen in the US but I can give you my two cents. 

I think both you and your brother have good and valid points, but I personally have to lean towards your brother’s points. The opportunities are greater in the US, people don’t interfere with your life, and I personally think you have more freedom. There’s less pollution, population, and it definitely is cleaner but I know India is taking initiatives against this.

Personally, I live in a place where I haven’t felt racism, haven’t been treated like a second class citizen and my social life has also been really good for me. I’m currently dating a Caucasian girl and I’m sure that’s not the norm and might be even be looked down by certain populations in India. And you get the chance to experience so many new cuisines as compared to India. Don’t get me wrong, Indian food is soo good but you can try something new everyday here. There are more opportunities here and there is a sense of a path for us here. I’m a huge traveler as well and ͏life is so much easier when traveling with a western passport as compared to an Indian one. Getting visas and showing paperwork when I had my Indian passport was such a pain. And even if you want to follow your dreams and want to go against the norm, people don’t care here. 

Granted there’s problems here as well such as expensive healthcare, racism, nepotism, etc. but I personally feel the pros far outweigh the cons. However, I’ve gone to India last summer and I can clearly say that I’ve been too “Americanized” and it came to a point where I don’t recognize India like I used to. So take my words with a grain of salt if you must and sorry if I was rambling haha. > Healthcare is really expensive.

Doesn't matter as long as you have a job-sponsored health insurance. If you don't have a job there, you can't live there unless you have a green card. So this is a moot point. For certain health costs like Dental and Vision, you can always take care of it on your annual India trip unless its an emergency.

> 2) Indians will always considered second rate citizens

Indians are considered second rate citizens even in their non-native state. I am more comfortable dealing with people and the police in the US than I am in another Indian state with a different local language.

> 3) economy does not favor the lower and middle class and makes it much harder to sustain a family of 4 than what it will be in India.

This really depends on the job and where you live. Can't really generalize. Economy doesn't favor the lower class but as a legal immigrant in the US you are not a part of the lower class.

> 4) legal problems and police matters siphon away time and energy more than what it will cost in india,

What? Seriously? I would say its the other way around. Law is very straightforward there and with accountability in most cases, unlike India. I haven't heard anyone just randomly having to deal with such issues.

> 5) the quality of life that everyone dreams of costs a lot of money in the name of taxes,

So whats your point? Either stay in India, pay less taxes and don't enjoy the same quality of life.

> 6)you will never be able to enjoy life like a white American and that's just true.

Neither will you be able to do that in India.

> 7) everything from starting a business to buying groceries is more expensive than what it cost for the same thing in India.

Sure that's called the Cost of Living. It does kind of correlate with the salary. You can't expect to earn western salaries but pay for stuff as you would in India.

There are valid reasons to prefer India over the US, but none of the ones you mentioned.

Edit: Also,

> He gave me his reasons why he thinks *USA is the best country to live in*

This is not true. There are better countries out there to live in than the US. You're both wrong in some ways. USA doesn't have a lot of the defects you mentioned, and also many of those points of comparison really don't make a lot of sense.  
But neither is USA objectively is the best country in the world to live in. It's not a utopia and has a lot of issues. Everyone has certain needs/wants that are unique to them and the weighing of those needs/wants dictate whether one situation is better than the other for that unique individual. No country is a bed of roses, it depends entirely on how one weighs each pro and con. 


 I grew up in India and moved to the US when I was 17. 

Although, I have never felt that subtle racism has somehow impeded my growth (professional and social) in the US, I can see how some folks have a harder time with it than me. 

I can tell you that based on my weightings, the US is way better suited for me than India. It’s not even close. 

I do also want to point out that even though some folks never get a chance to get green cards, they somehow do prefer the US to India. I know of a lot of people that bitch and moan about how bad America has been to them and how awesome India is but somehow have been here on H1Bs for more than a decade. I guess their weighting heavily falls on $$ because they don’t seem to enjoy any other aspect of this country. In fact, I personally don’t know of anyone who was here on a H1b and left the US on their own choice (I am sure there are a lot of them out there, just not known to me). Depends on where you live in India, how much you earn, your religion/caste. Life may be easier for you in India than US in certain scenarios. Nepotism is a fact of life across the world. It’s true even in the US. I left India after high school and have lived in the US now as a naturalized citizen for almost 3 decades. I think I could live in both countries and be happy but I chose to live in the US. I think your brother is more right than you but I caution you that it's just my humble opinion.

As a group, Indian Americans may face subtle racism but tbh I have never faced it, that I am aware of. I didn't have much money when I started but went to a good school and decided to start a business after. The business has flourished and I now employ other Americans of all shades, White, Asian, Black, etc. 

I have worked in corporate America and while that is soul sucking, it's not because I was Indian American. Has it negatively affected me, I am sure...but was there corruption in India... Absolutely. The thing about the US is that it exists in the extremes; at the very low and high end. What do I mean by that? Racists are usually found mouthing off because they are equivalent to the bums on the street. Nothing to lose and these people don't effect my life in any way, their frustrations come from society leaving them behind. On the high end, racism is more finessed. You can climb the ladder and experience great success based on your merit and talent but if you want to become a high ranking executive making in the 7 figures, you will have a hard time finding Indians there. 

You want to be successful and have a great quality of life, be smart, a great networker, don't just be friends with other Indians or family, go into business for yourself, venture away from the safe bet of medicine, IT, engineering, etc.

The US gun laws haven't affected me at all. I was a religious minority in India but as a kid never felt the burden of it growing up but as an adult I would rather be a ethnic minority in the US rather than a religious minority in India. I would rather be middle class in the US than India, everything is expensive but you also earn a hell of a lot more than you do in India. Water dude... these guys (USA) have clean water. Quality of life jumps up significantly in USA compared to India due to this one thing. Apart from that India I feel has everything or will get everything in a few years. 

Been in the US for one year now. You got money? Then india is lot better. Wow. 1thru7. So disconnected from reality. Neither of you are right, really.

> Healthcare is really expensive

That's the strongest argument against life in the US.

However, if you're a well-to-do software developer or doctor (or whatever well-earning field you are in), your employer-provided insurance will be excellent, and the options available are a lot better. If you go to an Indian doctor with an allergy complaint, they'll write you a bunch of antihistamimes that you take for your entire life and that's it. Here, you can go for immunotherapy. Same for every other medical problem (if your kid has autism or ADHD, barely a handful of doctors in Delhi or Mumbai or Bangalore are equipped to deal with it. Mental health issues are far better understood here).

> Indians will always considered second rate citizens

I couldn't give less of a fuck about what some farmer in rural Oklahoma or the white Subway server thinks of me. Joke's on them, you're a qualified engineer/doctor with an excellent education who vacations in Hawaii, and people in your work and community know your value and appreciate it.

> economy does not favor the lower and middle class

That's BS. You might be able to argue that QoL for the rich is comparable in India and US, but for a 50 percentile, it's a no-brainer comparison. A median earner in the US can afford a decent home, cars, central AC/heat, couple of hobbies, clean air, water, groceries, latest phones and computers. A median earner in India is angry because his Aadhaar at the ration shop does not work and he finds it difficult to get his foodgrains for the month. There is no piped water and he has to spend half a day arranging two vessels of water.

>  legal problems and police matters siphon away time and energy more than what it will cost in india

What legal problems? The laws are well-defined, bribes aren't necessary, you can go through your entire life without entering a court or a police station. And the only way police matters are settled in India faster is if you pay off all pissed off parties. 

The con is that if you're caught doing something technically illegal but harmless, there's no way out. Imagine being caught with pot in a state where it's illegal. You'll have problems and there's no shortcut out of it.

> the country has a better constitution and protects the citizens much better than Indian constitution

There's nothing wrong with the Indian constitution. It fundamentally guarantees freedoms, and constitutions are living documents that evolve along with society. Homosexuality for example, nothing in the constitution prevented it from being legalized, it just needed the society to arrive at a point where it would be okay.

The only thing that matters is the economic condition you arrive in the US in.

If you're an engineer with a Bay Area tech company with a 6-figure salary, there's nothing wrong with US. If you crossed over from Mexico illegally, your life will be hard. If you made it because of a brother/sister who got you a green card but aren't doctors/engineers, you'll do odd jobs like trucks, restaurant workers etc. you'll have to work hard. As someone who has traveled a lot around the world, always remember that you will always be a second class citizen abroad. The 2nd and the 4th point that your brother made is what almost all the people think for living in USA I guess.  Also not all the parts India is like that. I'm not Indian, but my wife is (she immigrated here), so just telling from my perspective. I've been to India several times, once for 3 months or so.

1. If you have good health insurance it's not that bad, but yes more expensive than India.

2. Not really true. Indians and other Asians are the most highly educated, drive the best cars, have the nicest houses, have more stable families, and other Americans in the last decades are more accurately perceiving them this way as well. People are more racist towards hispanics and blacks, since they have many more negative stereotypes. Also if you mean racism from businesses or their employees against Indians, then no, that will basically never happen. 

3. This is true. But if you gain specialized and marketable skills, the US is better to realize your income earning potential.

4. This makes no sense. What legal or police problems? If anything, the US is one of the best places to live if you're a law-abiding citizen. People follow much more rules here than in India, and there's basically almost 0 corruption. And for example you will never see a motorcycle riding on a sidewalk in the US.

5. That's true, but even if you're poor or middle class in the US, at least you can have clean air and there isn't rubbish everywhere. All homes and properties are built much larger in the US as well, even for people who are less well-off. 

6. Completely false. As far as I can tell, Indians and other Asians enjoy life more than most white Americans here, since they are more family oriented and have more money.

7. The labor pool is much more educated in the US, and it's easier to meet investors here, etc. Starting a business is practically free in the US. Investing in it isn't, of course. Groceries are more expensive, that's true, but there's also more options here to buy organic vegetables that weren't grown with pesticides.

I don't know if life is ""easier"" in the US, but I definitely enjoy not breathing in air pollution all the time, which is my #1 gripe about India. I love India but the air quality there has serious problems. Also India has terrible work hours for salaried employees which is why I'd never want to have a job there. 1. Good work life balance
2. You would be pleasantly surprised by customer care
3. Police is really strong. Attempting to bribe them for traffic offence can land you in jail. Corruption does exist, but not to the extent it does in India
4. Public have more common sense (even though they elected trump)
5. Less racism (india is more racist - color, caste, surnames etc does matter in India)

Negatives:

1. Healthcare is shit. But this is model India is going towards

2. Capitalism is nothing but modern feudalism. It is shit. But again, better than India. As an Indian who moved to the US and has been living here for nearly a decade, I think I can pitch in with my experience.

> 1) Healthcare is really expensive

If you're an Indian coming to US on a work visa, your health care will be sponsored by your company. I literally have the best health care plan available. Healthcare is expensive if you're out of insurance which you won't be if you're working. Most people you see complaining are people who do not have a job sponsored healthcare and they aren't Indians who've migrated.

> 2) Indians will always considered second rate citizens

Honestly, I saw more of this in India than here. People here have treated me with respect and till date I haven't seen any discrimination. They value performance regardless of skin color in most parts. I'm in the tech industry and my manager is white. He's the coolest guy I've ever worked under. My manager back in India used to discriminate against me cause I spoke a different mother tongue than him and favored guys who spoke the same.

> 3) economy does not favor the lower and middle class and makes it much harder to sustain a family of 4 than what it will be in India

Are you sure you have this correct? Okay let me put it this way. 90% of people coming from India will be coming on F1/H1 visa. Most F1 will eventually want to convert it to H1. In order to be eligible for H1 visa, the MINIMUM salary is 70K$ (roughly 42 LPA in INR). This is a govt requirement. Even counting COL and assuming your wife doesn't work, 70K can be easily sustainable amount for someone living frugally in most parts. That doesn't even account for the fact that I'm talking about bare minimum. I make more than twice that alone and I can easily sustain a family of 4.

I would in fact counter argue this point that it is getting next to impossible to sustain the same in India. Everything is expensive in India and salaries haven't kept up with the inflation rate. I still remember getting paid 35-40K when I started working and was barely able to meet the ends with rent and general costs eating a lot. In the US, most kids go to public schools which are really good unlike India where private schools literally cost an arm and a leg to put your kid through. 

> 4) legal problems and police matters siphon away time and energy more than what it will cost in india

I don't even know where you got that information from. Do you think every Indian that comes to the US starts getting into legal trouble? I've till date paid 0$ for anything related to my visa or to the cops. My company pays for my lawyers who do my paperwork and file my visas. In fact, they even pay for my stamping costs. In fact if I get into legal trouble, they can deport me so 99% of immigrants never do anything that lands them in trouble.

> 5) the quality of life that everyone dreams of costs a lot of money in the name of taxes

I pay 25% of my salary in taxes. I literally got more money in my tax returns (not even the taxes... Just the returns) than I made back in India. Grocery and rent is expensive but my salary more than makes up for it. I save more money in a month than my salary was back in India for an entire year. 

Also, the taxes you pay get you a lot more than what you get in India. Better infrastructure, better schools, better lifestyle etc.

> 6)you will never be able to enjoy life like a white American and that's just true.

Might be true but the life is 10x better than even an upper class Brahmin back in India (not a Brahmin... Just making a connection)

> 7) everything from starting a business to buying groceries is more expensive than what it cost for the same thing in India

As I mentioned, My salary is 20x that it was back in India. After a point, the grocery number doesn't scale. Grocery that would have cost 5K/month INR in India might cost me 20K/month but my salary more than makes up for it. An iPhone costs the same here as in India (in fact more there) and so do nearly all consumer goods. A car costs half of what it does in India. A car like an Accord which is considered 'Premium' back in India is common grade here. So yeah groceries and rent are the only 2 things that are a little expensive. Even eating out IMO is comparable to India. I recently visited India and 2 of us blew a bill of around 1500 (20$) eating in a normal place. Even here if me and my wife go out, we spend nearly 25-30$. 


It might seem like I've blowing the foreign trumpet but I'm just stating the facts. Life here is much better in terms of less pollution, less stress of commute and more money in general. This is not true that Indians cant match up to whities. Not at least in the major cities. Everybody is equal. If your brother thinks otherwise, he needs to gear up.

USA is a land of opportunities and you are in control of your future. USA is not the best country to live in dude.
Avoid it if possible, there are a lot of better countries than USA. If you have a decent job with good pay, can adapt well and learn the culture of the new place and like getting to know new people, you will love it here.

Indians are more racists and treat each other like 2nd class citizens. 

Police is actually very good in small and medium sized towns. If you behave properly and respect police, cops will give you full respect, more than what you can ever hope for in India.

Medical services are very advanced, high quality and excellent care by nurses and doctors. You need to have a good job through which you can get health insurance. On a spectrum, your comments heavily lean towards not-quiet-true and your brother’s points towards mostly-true. Without getting into details I would say if you have the opportunity to immigrate to US from India, do it. Life is vastly better. I'm an American... this thread is fascinating!  Health care is not bad if you have a good full time job.  It is only an issue or expensive here if you are unemployed or have a part time job. Every place has its pros and cons.  There are no absolutes.

Your argument points:

1. Yes, but if you are employed you can usually get good insurance.  But on the whole healthcare is a problem in the US.  But if you get some rare or cutting edge disease, US is your best bet to get cured.

2. Depends on where you live.  Usually bigger cities have less racism.  If you live in a rural area, you will experience more problems.  This problem is not specific to the US.  Even within India, if you live in a different state (especially where they speak a different language or if you stand out), you may experience some form of discrimination.  I have.  People are crazy everywhere.  If they see someone slightly different than themselves, they will try to create problems.  But on the whole I think Americans are less racist towards Indians than Indians are towards other Indians within India itself.  So far I have lived in India, US, England and I find the US to be the least racist/discriminatory among the three.

3. This also very much depends on your profession.  There are many skilled professions (technology, medicine, law, etc.) where you can make a lot of money in the US.  Don't expect to be an average person in the US and make a good living.  It doesn't happen in the US and not in India either.

4. I disagree with this one.  There are always exceptions, but in general, law enforcement in the US is way better than in India.  In India many times you don't even have a legal recourse.  In the US it is very easy to sue someone.  And court cases don't drag on for decades.  I will trust the American police on their worst day more than I would ever trust the Indian police.  Also, general physical safety (if you are a man) is better in India than in the US.  On the other hand, India is more unsafe for women and in terms of road accidents.

5. I'm not sure what you mean.  Yes, there are taxes in the US.  Same as in India.  The quality-of-life again depends very much on your situation.  Many times you can buy better homes in the US for less money than you can in big Indian cities.

6. Again, not sure what you mean.  How does a white American enjoy life differently than an Indian?

7. True, but you also earn much more here.  Entry level engineers in my company earn $80k ( ~ 55 lakh Rs).  No way in India can you do that.  Many things (from businesses to groceries) are also of better quality in the US than they are in India.

Your brother's arguments:

1. That is true.  Also the law enforcement is better in the US than in India.  Corruption is definitely much less in the US.

1. Police - generally true.  American police on the whole are much less corrupt than Indian police.  But even then they are far from perfect.  Police here are indicated all the time for misuse of power, and all kinds of things.

2. Kind of true.  USA is not the best in this regard by far.  If this is a big consideration for you, Scandinavian countries fare much better than the US.  But yes, I think USA is still better than India in this regard.

3. Again, the absolutes are not true.  Nepotism does exist here (think about Ivanka Trump tagging along with Donald Trump on state visits) but generally is not as bad as in India.

4. Pollution exists here too, but I agree that on an average it is much better and cleaner here than in India.

5. Life can be easier here - depends on your situation.  But things generally do tend to work as expected.  Lots of convenience.  You don't have to run around to get everything done.

You didn't mention politics :-) so I will add that.  Right now the Indian politics seems a bit better organized than the American side.  The 2 major parties here (Republicans and Democrats) are both absolute complete disasters.  The BJP at least for the time being (because of strong leadership at the top layers) seems to be better motivated to fix the nation's problems.

Having said all that, I will say that there are countries with better overall Quality-of-Life than the US.  Canada, Many European countries, especially Scandinavian countries, Australia, New Zealand, all rank higher than the US.

On the other hand, if your main goal is to make a lot of money AND if you are highly skilled in an in-demand field, US is probably the best place for that.

If you are not highly-skilled, the Middle-East may be a better option to do more mundane jobs and still make a decent amount of money. So I was born in America and reside in the US right now. My parents were born in India and came here a year or so before I was born. Here’s my two cents. 

I think your brother is in the right here. The opportunities are greater in the US, people are not racist if you don’t bring it up on yourself, and I personally think you have more freedom. There’s less pollution, life is more relaxed and slow paced with more vacations and fun things in life and definitely isn’t boring, the population isn’t busting at the seams, and it definitely is cleaner but I know India is taking initiatives against this (I can’t speak for its effectiveness).

Personally, I live in a place where I haven’t felt racism, haven’t been treated like a second class citizen and my social life has also been really good for me. In my experience racism is only a case for Indians who cling onto their Indian culture, traditions, and most importantly their accents. I’ve witnessed a very villager-equestrian Indian who spoke incomprehensible English and wouldn’t get along with anyone. He experienced racism and truthfully I don’t blame the white people in having to deal with him. Overall, there are more opportunities here and there is a sense of a path for us here. I’m a huge traveler as well and ͏life is so much easier when traveling with a western passport as compared to an Indian one. Getting visas and showing paperwork when I had my Indian passport was such a pain. And even if you want to follow your dreams and want to go against the norm, people don’t care here.

I live in a southern state and the people here and delightful and definitely not as racist as some people you might meet in places like California and New York. 

I personally feel the pros far outweigh the cons. However, I’ve gone to India last summer and I can clearly say that I’ve been too “Americanized” and it came to a point where I don’t recognize India like I used to. So take my words with a grain of salt if you must and sorry if I was rambling haha."
Police/Economy,Learning from history: Yugoslavia's descent into chaos and lessons for India.,112,c4648f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4648f/learning_from_history_yugoslavias_descent_into/,24,1561331501.0,"I just finished reading this book called Rose of Sarajevo. Its a story set in the tumultuous days just before the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars and genocides that followed after. The book details how Slobodan Milosevic and other Serbian ultra-nationalists unleash a campaign of fear and hatred towards other ethnicities in Yugoslavia. 

He whipped up passions of Serbians living in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo and claimed they were under attack from the other ethnicities. 

He demonized the Bosniaks and reduced them to a purely Muslim identity so that they could be tagged as outsiders despite hundreds of years of shared history with other ethnicities in Bosnia and a complex identity with which they viewed themselves. Bosniak Muslims were also pejoratively referred to as Turks, meaning that because they were muslim their allegiance lay to the nearest Muslim country.

He had an associate who controlled Belgrade TV network and inflamed passions with fiery, racist and misleading content played again and again. 

When a Serbian soldier was killed along with other ethnicities by an Albanian soldier, Milosevic's stooges arranged for a large public funeral for the soldier even against the wishes of the soldier's parents. They used this occasion to spew further venom against other ethnic groups.

When Milosevic went to Kosovo to address incidents of violence there, a large contingent of Serbs showed up, transported there mysteriously, in a massive show of strength even though their actual population in Kosovo was less than 10%. He used the occasion to repeat that Serbs were being attacked and killed in Kosovo even though news reporters couldn't corroborate any of the incidents he was talking about.

Milosevic was a powerful orator and had loyal support among most of the Serbs. Liberal Serbs were clamped down upon during his regime.

Serbs detested the long rule of Josef Tito, who for all his flaws, stressed on unity amongst the various ethnic groups and suppressed Serbian nationalism. With Milosevic's rise to power, Serbs saw an opportunity to gain back what they thought was denied to them under Tito.

Eventually the Yugoslav National Army was ordered to attack its own people including the Slovenians, Croats and Bosniaks. These ethnicities deserted the army and it became an Army only of Serbs distrusted throughout the republic. In many places it became a war between the local police force and the Yugoslav army.

There were many such incidents detailed in the book and I was quite surprised to see that I could make out parallels with what we have seen in India in the past and present. When we talk of fascists in India, we often draw comparisons to Hitler and Nazi Germany. But in many ways I found Yugoslavia to be a closer parallel considering it too was a republic with a diverse population mix. It had similar problems with respect to ethnic and language nationalism, federal division of powers leading to political conflict and a well functioning economy that all unravelled in the years of conflict from the 90s. 

Would highly recommend people to read this book just to understand how it all went down in Yugoslavia. I hope India and other nations learn from such experiences.",AtreusStark," Ya but the size is different. Yugoslavia is comparable to what happens in 3 neighboring districts in India. We have 700+.

If you are interested in macro stuff check out Niall Ferguson's  Square and the Tower. It's more useful when you think about things at India's scale. There is a really good BBC documentary on the Yugoslav wars that talk about this too:

DM me if anyone needs ebooks. Many things are different between India and Balkans. The commonalities you see are just problems and also politics concomitant in such diverse hotchpotch of ethnicities. 

Firstly, the Balkans fostered strong nationalist fervour since the time they were under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Remember Gavrilo Princip?

Secondly, the Ustashe committed crimes that supersede those of nationalist Serbs under Milosevic. The nationalism of the Serbs were easy to be infused with the hatred towards Croats given this background. The scale of hatred might be many times the odium that partition brings to Indian Islamophobes.  The Balkan scenario was already a powderkeg when it was under Tito's leadership.

The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is closer to the situation that Indian context. These Caucus countries were boxed in by the might of Russian SSR, but the situation was alight after the Soviets collapsed.

I followed the conflict in the newspapers as the conflict unraveled. I could only read articles in the ""world"" sections in the newspapers. The burning of the ministry building in Sarajevo and the Siege maps are snapshots that I can still remember. The literature and coverage then was not as widespread as it is now. Indian channels don't cover foreign conflicts yet, but there are the kinds of BBC, Al-Jazeera available to educate oneself on those matters.

(Edit) P.S: The author of the book I see is a Bosniak. Do you find her opinion neutral? Yeah, you got few things wrong. Every part of SFRY (todays independent states) had Teritorial defence corps (TO), along whit Yugoslav National Army (JNA). War started with TO attacking Serbian people who wanted to stay in united country. Other thing is that there was no Serbian nationalism during Tito's reign, but Croatian (MASPOK) in the '70's. Serbs accepted living in the same country with Croats who killed around 300.000 Serbs during WW2 (only concetration camp for kids was in WW2 Croatia). Author of that book is biased and paints things black and white. If you dig really deep you'll find many things that would change your view. There were war crimes on all sides, but Serbian ones are more spoken about because of Serbia's relations with Russia More than religious extremism, India's biggest problem in the next two decades will be climate change led environmental issues. Upvoted for this deep thought.

In a way dictators are necessary evils, look at Iraq now, perhaps Saddam was the necessary force to keep things in check.

I really feel the Gandhian ideals which drove a path of peace and accomodation is the reason for the success of our nation despite our differences, else we would have become balkanized as you say. Now we have opposite ideals and can get catalysed by tough situations such as global warming can lead to such an unpleasant future as you mentioned The origin region for the term Balkanization. [deleted] This. People need to read the history of other countries and learn from them. 

Sadly, the current trend in India seems to be that of reading too much into myths and assuming them as real history. Great post"
Police/Economy,At each-other's throats,11,cyleal,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cyleal/at_eachothers_throats/,2,1567434710.0,"I was just sitting, reading a newspaper when my phone rung. I reached for it and swiped the screen. It's an unknown number.

Caller: ""Hello""

Me: ""Yes?""

Caller: ""Sir, your ATM has been blocked. If you want to keep using your card, you must pay...""

I hung up the call. I am aware enough to know that that's not how banks function. Which, obviously, makes it a fraud. But how many people are aware of this?

It's not like this is first time I've crossed paths with this practice either.

In the past week, one of my uncles has been ripped off of ₹25,000/- in a PayTM scam.

Another uncle, I suspect, is participating actively in a bank fraud as the manager of a prominent bank.

Which is why, I wasn't surprised when I quite surprised when I read about scams and frauds on r/India these days. These are not immensely popular threads and usually fly under the radar for most of you, I imagine. And these are not all.

[Indian banks have reported **73%** spike in frauds at Rs 71,543 cr in FY19](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/banks-see-whopping-73-spike-in-frauds-at-rs-71543-cr-in-fy19/articleshow/70075131.cms?from=mdr).

[PayTM frauds like the one my uncle recently fell a victim to, are ubiquitous](https://www.gadgetsnow.com/tech-news/paytm-fraud-2-arrested-juvenile-apprehended-for-cheating-people/articleshow/66525465.cms).

Everytime I'm in Canada, I get [CRA and immigration scam calls from Indians](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/national-cra-india-rcmp-scam-1.4883796) on a regular basis.

And banking-related scams like the one from my experience moments ago, have shot up in the recent times, based on my personal experience. I've lived in India most of my life and I have hardly gotten as many frauds calling me as I do nowadays.

Why is that? Why are we seeing such a sharp spike in these illicit activities just now? Well, I believe the answer to that is simple: 

When a nation's economy is brutally murdered and left to rot in the sewers, when millions of people lose their jobs in an instant yet they refuse to acknowledge the situation and cheer their leader on who took their jobs away and distracting them by merely appeasing to their nationalistic side, what you are left with is those same people turning to scamming and defrauding their own countrymen.

Because after their celebration is over and they return home, that's when reality hits- pseudo nationalism doesn't feed your family. So they do the one thing that they can do- resort to activities that lead to the results as discussed above. Like shipwrecked men turning to seawater from thirst, these desperate nationalists decide to be at each-other's throats and in that instant, unbeknownst to them, their hypocrisy of being a nationalist is exposed, for a nationalist, a real one, first and foremost, considers his/her countrymen equal and treats them with respect. But it seems the definition these days has changed to blindly following your leader down the cliff.

I won't be surprised if in the coming days, India is engulfed in flames with unemployed rioters and anti-social elements clash with the police in the streets. An economy dead in the water combined with a largely uneducated and superstitious citizenry can have further reaching consequences than one might imagine.",HANDSOME_RHYS," I kid you not my uncle received a same kinda call and he heard him out and then said

I was under the impression that crime in cities are lesser than what it was 20yrs ago.

I remember Bangalore had gangs and rowdies near kr market, kalasipalya etc, I would consider it relatively safe by now.  I respectfully disagree. Not saying economy is not a problem, but I thing th biggest issue we have is population. Population trumps everything.  You talk about societal problems and now you’re saying gdp will be better hence everything will be okay. 

India is a deeply feudal country. If you want to see real progress, people need to move out of feudal mindset and have some basic human courtesy. 

Also the population of India will keep rising. This is not good. China is managing well due it’s infrastructure and efficiency in all aspects. Not the case with India. The sheer amount of population will thwart any real attempts at progress. Unemployment and underemployment are underrated threats to Indian society.  That's what I thought 10 years back. I have never been so wrong in my life.  India has structural issues beyond just what the economycan solve.
Much of the country is illiterate by any ""rational"" standard - i do not mean that they go to school, but that they can read and write a single language.
Caste, religion, tribalism, racism, intolerance in general are issues that are not strongly correlated to pure economic growth with a great degree of reliability, but they also inhibit growth.
The kind of economic growth in this environment is likely to act as a feedback that reinforces these beliefs and social pressures into new displays of bias, but it will not make it easier to tackle. I agree, I think. Speaking as someone who remembers the state we were in 20 years ago, another 20 will make a huge difference. May not take us to complete first-world-levels, but definitely will help.  [removed] been reading mihir sharma, ruchir sharma and watching hans rosling, have you? In my personal opinion, the biggest problem is the flight of knowledge-workers to wherever the fuck they can go to. 
I am not talk about IIT-IIM or similar elites, but doctors, nurses, mathematicians, physicists, statisticians, et al. 

Intra-country immigration is also a problem, if you look at the workforce employed in forward economy, they come from all walks of life but live in few major centres of the country. Those metros benefit hugely with higher rents and higher spending by the new workforce.

Growth is where consumption is. 

PS: Seems like I reached the same conclusion as the OP.




 OP is just ranting, without any credit to his argument. We all know that with a better economy everything may improve- education, infrastructure, employment etc. But the people have to change too. What development will we achieve when we chase away world class economists? When we have produce the most engineers in the world, but 90% of them are unemployable? When the people dont pay taxes? When we support rapists?That people here don't want to grow, to move out of there comfort zone? Even I could go on and on, OP.  Unless you have anything substantive to say, stop wasting our funding time. It is. And it's true with any country or region in the world. 
Economy determines the distribution of resources, when there is no mobility in it due to lack of new opportunities, resources lie unutilised, and dissatsifaction follows. The real problem with India is that there are too many Indians There are several problems with this country. Why pretend there arent? 


Yes simplifying things makes it easier to understand, But countries with strong booming economies have problems too. A strong economy can solve some issues, not all. A substantial police force for patrolling.

More jobs , an empty mind is a devil's workshop.

Create a positive environment of well-being of common people. 20? I’d say 70.  Also things like CCTV, mobile phone recordings, car GPS, concealable mini cameras and other such tech advancements will bring down crime rates too, not just the GDP growth. Thanks Tubbs "
Police/Economy,Is India really that horrible?,76,9726q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9726q1/is_india_really_that_horrible/,148,1534223229.0,"I was born in Delhi but only lived there the first 2 years of my life. I've lived in the US for 17 years since. I'm currently in my second year of college here. 

Even though I never truly ""lived"" in India, every time I go there I am fascinated by it. Honestly, despite being in America pretty much my whole life, I still consider myself an Indian by heart (I can't really explain why, but I just feel more spiritually connected to India than America) 

My whole life my parents and family have told me about the incredible developments happening in India. The famous ""7% GDP growth"", ""India overtakes _____ as __ largest economy"", bla bla bla. 

Personally, I feel way more at peace and comfortable and ""free"" when I visit India than I am in America. I've always felt people here are always in their suit-and-ties, meaning they operate with many filters and it's tough to really grasp the genuine nature of a person. Furthermore, people here are quite ignorant of other cultures - I know several people who don't know what the Mexican flag looks like despite it being our neighbor, and several people ask me what Dubai is like even though it's not even in India. 

Culturally, I like Bollywood way more than Hollywood (my favs are Mera Naam Joker, Kabuliwala, and Guzaarish) and I've remained attached to always developing my Hindi skills as well as my religious affiliation with being Hindu. 

But man... after going through this subreddit, you guys really come off as extremely depressing. Seems like 90% of the posts on here are just shitting on India and everything about it. 

Even as an outsider and as young as I am, I know there are tremendous problems with the country - rape, lack of opportunities, income inequality, education, cleanliness, pollution, horrible ways of thinking... but surely one can still live a comfortable life in India and surely it has a solid future ahead of it? 

As young and unexperienced I am, every time I go to Delhi I feel such pride in seeing the developments that have taken place from my previous visits. The metro system. The new technologies springing up on a daily basis. Incredibly posh areas where honestly I've had more fun than some places even in Los Angeles, Chicago, etc. 

America is far from a heaven. Rape, sexual assault, mental health, sexual and general education, drug use (and the drug war in general), racism, police violence, corruption, and bigotry is rampant here too. I have seen incredibly poor lifestyles of people here as well, such as an unemployed drug addicted single mom with three kids living in an incredibly terrible part of town. 

My family is financially in the top 5% here in the States. I've always lived extremely comfortably. Perhaps I'm spoiled. I know that many of the luxuries I have here would be difficult to attain in India, but honestly I'd rather have more of a taste of the personal freedom I have felt there than the material objects I have here. 

Perhaps I'm just a follower of the ""grass is always greener on the other side"" mantra but man... this subreddit really kills my pride of being an Indian by heart. It's great seeing actual discussion on here sometimes, but sometimes I feel terrible for reading all the horrible things many of you have to say about the country and it makes me wonder if there is even any hope. 

My ultimate life dream since I was a kid was to go back to India permanently one day and do whatever I can to help improve things, but judging by the harshness of this sub, perhaps that is just a childish pipe dream than a possible reality. ",kunechi_," [removed] INDIA IS HEAVEN FOR THE RICH AND A HELLHOLE FOR THE POOR !

People here are not shitting on India just for the sake of shitting.


The young person who lives in India, works to contribute towards the 7% GDP  and pays a third of its salary in tax, gets screwed day in and day out.
Its a daily struggle for an honest citizen to get essentials like continuous power supply, running water, decent public transport and roads. That's the reason he is frustrated and will be until the government and the system stops being a bitch of the rich and powerful.


To anyone who gives me the 'India Shining' gyan, I tell them to come live here for just 6 months - In a polluted city, travel in a shitload of traffic and pollution to a mediocre job and come back to sleep in a 10 by 10 room without fan because the power is out. 


Once you have lived that life, then tell me that you are proud of India.
 > America is far from a heaven

But it is still closer to heaven than India without any doubt. I have been in both worlds for equal period in the last 7 years, and I would definitely prefer America over India any day just for the standard of living it provides.

> My family is financially in the top 5% here in the States. I've always lived extremely comfortably. Perhaps I'm spoiled. I know that many of the luxuries I have here would be difficult to attain in India, but honestly I'd rather have more of a taste of the personal freedom I have felt there than the material objects I have here. 

People always tend to seek what they don't have and can't appreciate what they have. And you are no exception. A top 5% in the US is probably equivalent to top 1% in India. You will not have any problem whatsoever in India with that riches. Please do thank your parents for that.

> My ultimate life dream since I was a kid was to go back to India permanently one day and do whatever I can to help improve things, but judging by the harshness of this sub, perhaps that is just a childish pipe dream than a possible reality. 

Believe me but that was every child's pipe dream. The harshness that you see in this thread is the bursting of that very dream and refusal to accept the sad reality. I really urge you to leave your wealth, settle down here and run your life with a job so that you would understand. As they say, don't judge a person without walking in their shoes. Depends on which strata of society you belong to.

Its great for the rich, horrible for middle class and poor people. Going to India to visit vs living in India on a daily basis are two very different things. You don't have to deal with traffic, bad infrastructure, long lines on a daily basis. Govt beauracracy, corrupt cops, big govt scams are a norm that you are not exposed to.


Sure America has its problems but as a developed country that has solved all the basic problems, most of the problems barring racism, school shootings are first world problems.

I have been on both sides and while I remember my  days of growing up in Pune fondly with a heavy heart, I know that I my life is way better in US.  Last winter, I was at a traffic  signal when two completely naked kids - around 3-4 years old - went around asking for alms. They were shivering but their parents/handlers had made them strip to increase their chances of getting money. I called up 100 to report this, but they hung up the phone twice.

So yeah. Pretty horrible. Don't have to go too far. Thr wretchedness you witness at any random traffic signal is enough. Beggars purposefully chop of their arms and wound themselves to get more money Put into context, India is not bad at all. No country which started where we started has come where we are today. TN Ninan in his recent book points this out. Manmohan Singh pointed out that in 1947, India was, per capita, THE poorest country in the world. 

Enlightenment doesn't just descend upon a country and its people. Its a slow cultivation over generations with stories of success and failure over multiple generations till they become ingrained ethics. The West had hundreds of years of trial and error with some extremely low points, including huge genocides, continent wide bloodbath, mass species extinction, near destruction of European ecology, continent-wide bloodbaths, slavery and colonialism to arrive at where it is now. We need more time to learn. A civilization is not built in 50 years.  

What we need is people like us who have seen how the world works to not ridicule the feeling of the masses without understanding their upbringing and experience. A lot of people have given you quite a few answers here. I agree with some of the facts that they have stated but I disagree with their conclusion.

They are right to tell you that it's going to be hard for you. India is chaotic and corrupt in a way that it is hard for someone who has lived in the west to understand. But that does not mean that your desire to be Indian is somehow childish as many our esteemed redditors seem to think. Being spiritually connected to your country is nothing to be ashamed of. This was and always will be the land of your ancestors. 

India is developing and growing steadily- socially, economically and institutionally. Most of the negativity that you see here is just because a lot of the things that are happening right now were hidden before, but now that there are hundreds of news sources they come in the limelight, whether it be rape or communalism.

I was born in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, one of the states that this subreddit has enormous contempt for. I lived first  5 years of my life in a small village, and I still go there twice or thrice every year. In my own lifetime of 26 years, I have seen enormous progress made by the people, the institutions as well as the businesses in my state. Religious violence between Hindus and Muslims has steadily decreased and is still decreasing. Women are much more free and eve-teasing etc are decreasing day by day. Literacy has increased steadily and I am confident that in 10-15 years it will reach almost 95%. Even corruption is decreasing( thought not as fast as other things). In my own village, we used to have just 2-3 sets of clothes and nobody owned a vehicle. There were no toilets, no electricity and certainly no amenities. FFS there were dacoits. DACOITS. Yeah it was that bad just 20 years ago. Now, all that has changed. Consumption in villages has increased and the farmers(my own grandfather was one) who used to live on a subsistence level, today sell most of their produce. Women have their own small businesses and they freely travel to distant schools/colleges without fear of harassment. 

I am not saying that we are anywhere close to the West, but we are getting there. 

India has a large population and its at a lower level of development. So any action that you take here, has a far greater effect in the lives of your people than it would have in the west. And believe me, there are more than enough opportunities to do so.

Let me reiterate, this is not going to be easy for you. It's an uphill battle. You will have to fight corruption, pettiness, apathy and the worst of all, pity and contempt. This will come from those who believe that it was their nation who failed them and that there is nothing of value in this country.

They are not entirely wrong. You get only one life after all. Especially you - who has a golden ticket to life. What is the use of wasting it on a cesspit like India? A state that discriminates against people of merit and rewards those who break the rules. A country without enough opportunities for  even the engineers/doctors/professionals it creates by the truckload. 

It takes sacrifice to build a nation. It takes courage, knowledge and a whole lot of foolhardy stubbornness to change things. It takes a degree of masochism, knowing that most people won't even acknowledge the things that you do and most of those who do, would like nothing more than to see you fail.

At the end you must ask yourself. What kind of love do you have for India? 

Do you love it like how one loves a beautiful car that one owns? You want everyone to praise it and think what a cool guy you are for having it.  If this is the case, stay where you are. There is nothing immoral or wrong about this choice. We are all different people with different goals. 

Or do you love it like a small plant that is yours, which you water and care for diligently despite the fact that no one gives a flying crap about it and your irrational love for it.

If this is the case, then study hard and when you feel you are ready, come home. I have been reading a lot about the problems in India on Reddit but haven't come across any post which discusses the solution to the existing problem. May be we all have come to terms with the fact that nothing can be changed in this country or are happy with the current scheme of things. I feel really sad to see people killing in the name of religion, caste discrimination, economic inequality et al 

Our country need people who care for the nation and want to change the way things work in the country.

I am sure we, the youth, will bring change in the country. 

Happy Independence Day!!

P.S. This post might be off-topic and irrelevant to point of discussion. You can ignore this. [deleted] Once you have got used to the way of life in US, you may find it difficult to adjust to India. I know of two families in my close circle who made the big move back, but returned to US after a couple of years after being unable to cope with some aspects of life here.

That said, this is very much your country to explore and assimilate and appreciate its beauty as much as you like on your vacation time. I don't know why but this reminds me of Akshay Kumar. So you decide your coming back to India based on a  subreddit? What do you know of India's problems when you're not even living here? Speak to an American and they'll give you a good picture about what they think about India. If you gain pride by false glorification and ignorance, feel free to browse facebook or Quora. Most of stuff posted here is news ie what is happening on a daily basis. If that hurts your nationalist pride, maybe you should do something to fix the situation instead of ranting from foreign land. Let me try explain as someone who lived in India for 23 years and in US for last 3 years. Its true both countries has problems but there is a difference in scale. For example you said there is mental health problem in US. At least US aware of the mental health issue and trying to work out a solution however slow the progress may be. Where as in India there are far more serious problems to deal with like education, employment, providing basic needs like food and water, electricity. Mentally challenged people don't even get treatment they require or support from government. 

It unlikely for you to understand some of the problems with out actually facing them yourself. Imagine being in a home on a hot summer day when there is power cut and you feel like you are on a frying pan. There are no power cuts in US so you won't even realize this as a problem. 

People here are complaining because we know we can do better.  [removed] Tho aajao kabhi hamarey gali mein.., patha chal jatha.., Unfortunately, India really is that horrible.

A better, more sensible version of that is:

>The degradation of public institutions, the shocking misogyny and caste-ism, the strengthening of religious fundamentalism (of all religions), the brutal and arbitrary nature of the criminal justice system, the presence of jihadists in Kashmir and Naxalites in central-east India, the horrible economic conditions, the environmental degradation, the non-existent health facilities which fail to prevent the most common tragedies and the criminalization of our political class are reasons why India is not a very desirable place to live.

I do not celebrate this fact. I am living in Australia and am a permanent resident here. I will, within the year be a citizen of this country.

I know where you're coming from. I will confess that I think of India almost every day and will never stop being an Indian, no matter what my passport would say.

>My ultimate life dream since I was a kid was to go back to India permanently one day and do whatever I can to help improve things, but judging by the harshness of this sub, perhaps that is just a childish pipe dream than a possible reality.

If it is any consolation, most of my favourite Indians: Naoriji, Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, CV Raman, Subramanyam Chandrasekhar, Satish Dhawan etc either lived for decades in foreign countries or were educated there and they learnt the best practices of the west and returned to India.

But before they were able to contribute anything worthwhile, they all had to take a good, hard, honest and uncompromising look at India.

From the vocabulary used in your post, I have to conclude that you (at this moment, may change) have more in common with a 1960s hippie than the people mentioned above.

You ""feel more spiritually connected to India than America"", you bemoan the cultural ignorance of Americans, assuming that Indians' is better, you are disgusted with the reckless materialism of the Americans with their ""suit-and-ties"", but have you ever seen an Indian IT office? Nothing is more farcical than 30-40 adult men working in hot weather wear stifling suit and ties desperate for employment in the west.

I do not want to discourage you too much. There is still nobility to be found in India. People like **JBS Haldane** and **Jean Dreze** gave up their British and Belgian citizenship for the sake of Indian passports and they have greatly contributed to India. But they do not and did not have your idea of India. Theirs was more realistic. They loved the country not because of an imagined greatness, but had a more balanced and honest view.

My advise to you would be to engage honestly with India. To read independent news, read high-rate scholarship, research great NGOs that are doing great work. Understand what India really is. Not for the armchair pseudo-intellectuals like me, but for the vast majority of its people. This itself will be a great contribution. Keep livinig in your posh Indian bubble. Yes India has surpassed France in terms of growth and GDP. Does it show you the bigger picture no it doesnt. France has a population of 66.9 millions while India has 1.2 Billion do you think its a great achievement to surpass gdp of a smaller country with smaller population? 

According to world bank 276 million people live for less than 1.25 usd per day. I am sure you never met any of these people. Have you ever tried traveling in a city bus in India? Waited for hours for a train to fight for a seat with a passenger ticket? Maybe you love the street food in India just try and visit a thela walas house probably they would be sharing a small room with 5-6 people.  Watch Swades.
If it hits you hard you might want to come back.

You were born in India so come home and become a lawmaker.

We need people like you who have a broader perspective and can bring the best of both worlds. >- rape, lack of opportunities, income inequality, education, cleanliness, pollution, horrible ways of thinking...

Umm those are like the basic necessities for a comfortable and happy life? How can one live a comfortable life if those specific parameters are not fulfilled? You have a comfortable and easy life, that's why you have a bent perspective on these issues.
 People who live in a different country always romanticize their homeland. I feel part of it is cause you guys don't see the daily happenings here unless it's something major. ""But man... after going through this subreddit, you guys really come off as extremely depressing. Seems like 90% of the posts on here are just shitting on India and everything about it.""

This is what Trump infers by trumping on about ""fake news"". News has different perspectives. Your south Delhi perspective is just as valid as all the negative news on here. 

Everyone is entitled to their own perspectives - it does not matter what they are. Negative news is just as true as your view of India.

Mother India embraces them all.  India is fine. Fucked up in a million ways but also fine in many ways. That doesn't mean it will always be fine, other countries that are at India's level of GDP per capita are in advanced institutional disarray, and our high levels of stupidity, hyper-religiosity and low levels of rationality makes us one riot away from being dragged back to the early 90s or 2002. India's institutions need to be vigorously defended by those that live there who are educated enough to understand their importance (very few relative to full population), and and this will need to continue for many more decades.

>My ultimate life dream since I was a kid was to go back to India permanently one day and do whatever I can to help improve things, but judging by the harshness of this sub, perhaps that is just a childish pipe dream than a possible reality.

You won't be able to move back. You would be too soft to survive here, specially if you are bullshitting about spirituality (India is more materialist than the US - are you getting your information about the country from a fucking Yoga pamphlet?) and think people on this reddit are being negative are 'affecting your Indian pride' (poor baby) instead of recognizing them as possibly the last line of defense against the wannabe fascists currently in power now that the mainstream media has been bought.

I've seen quite a few dumbfuck Modi-loving NRI families feed their children this shit and interacting with those guys and their warped sense of reality is nauseating, if I had to guess I'd guess you'd be from one of those.

Grow the fuck up. A person can certainly live a good life in India, but we have real problems, and every piece of evidence in your post suggests that you don't have skin to deal with those. Go to kasol also , you will find better weed than in US. India has achieved a LOT in the last 3 decades. This growth is still happening and will continue to happen.

But the problem is that the rate of growth is still not good enough. We still have a lot of basic problems that still needs to be solved asap-  poverty, pollution, human-rights abuses, infrastructure problems etc etc. And add to this, the present govt has been terrible to institutions that built this growth and have been pushing a cultural fascist narrative that is slowly turning the country into a communal tinderbox.


To sit back and pat our backs for achievements, while fighting such enormous  difficulties, is not something everyone can afford to do. And this sub has become far too political and simplistic to have a balanced view of the situation. But the achievements of India are hard earned and it is very important to remain ever vigilant and keep this growth going. Lot of aggressive replies in this thread. Some people getting defensive because they feel like they’re being lectured by an ABCD. 

That said, it is difficult to form the right perception of India. India still treats most of her citizens poorly. Most people do struggle for the absolute basics. Things that rich Indians and Americans take for granted, like putting your kid through a decent school till 12th standard is the Impossible Dream for 80% of Indians. We take washing machines, TVs, air conditioners  and fridges for granted, but 95% of Indians don’t own those. 

At the same time it was better than it used to be. 25 years ago, even the top 5% didn’t have these things. Owning a car was an impossible luxury, not achievable like it is now. 

It’s this contradiction that causes so much strife. On one hand there are people proud that we’ve made this progress in 25 years. They’re optimistic that the change in the next 25 will be even more rapid. On the other hand there are people who are impatient. 25 years is a tiny fraction of the time that this subcontinent has existed, but it is a long time in a person’s life. They’ve been promised so much, and they see so little. They’ve been told that India is Shining for 2 decades now and yet in 2018 they see so much room for improvement. Of course they’re glad that we’re no longer obsessed with just the basics of roti-kapda-makaan and we’ve moved on to demanding law and order, 24x7 water and electricity, top quality public transport etc. Its just that they’re pessimistic about seeing these in their life times. 

When people who are in mindset #1 meet others of mindset #2, they’re almost irreconcilable. #1 sees an anti-national pessimist who only bitches 24x7. #2 sees a blind optimist bhakt who can’t wake up to reality. 

We’ll get better, slowly. At least, I hope so.  India isn’t “horrible” - I’m literally American born and raised and I love living in India more than I love living in America

Life in India is far far better than life in the US if you’re wealthy here. You have everything you did in the US but you also have culture, community, religion, people and family. You also have more labor, less regulation and low wages here. The quality of life only changes drastically if you’re middle class. 

Now of course you need to be fluent in the language too and preferably speak Hindi like a native speaker with no accent. 

If you’re asking why the Indian middle class isn’t close to as rich as the American middle class, well a 200 year head-start sure does help doesn’t it? India become a country less than 90 years ago and was a socialist hellhole for most of its nascent years.  You don't realise just how tough it is to live in India. Living in India is extremely difficult and that's why everyone is salty because people want it to get better If your family is in the top 5% of the US, you’ll be fine anywhere really. 

India is a good country, but it’s a frustrating country. Especially the poorer you get, or if you happen to be of lower caste. Things are changing and there are heartwarming stories of solidarity, so we can hope for the better. 

One thing I can assure you: The US is a far better country for your self-development. And by that I mean the realization of your full potential. You can do it in India too, but it’ll be much harder.  Mate, people have opinion most of us here are from the cream class, good schooling and internet access, but if you speak to anot so privileged person- his definition for issues would be different, he wouldnt care about government, rape, gdp etc..

So in a nut shell, every country has issues and goes through phases - whatever it is, it is land of billions and yes only bad news makes to front page a lot of good things happen everyday.
Do come back.. And welcome 😊 US is better, stay there.  As an outsider coming in for visits and generally observant from afar, you are divorced from living through the lows every day and grapple with the natural human tendency to better remember the highs you feel. 
India isn't a shithole, neither is it a paradise. By and large, the average indian is struggling to get by and doing their best to keep up with current affairs - as is the norm in any developing country. 
I don't think many people here would deny feeling the attachment you feel towards the country. Heck, I want to die here, in my home city, not wanting to leave unless things get so desperate that I become a refugee (hint: not gonna happen). 
But there is growing dissatisfaction. We have constantly been promised and left high and dry before every election. With the internet hitting its peak potential only recently, it's natural to see rancour more obvious than say, quiet satisfaction. What's important to understand is that a sense of perception is probably the single most important baseline for judgement, so maybe consider that :) The upper class don't find it bad at all since they get all the benefits and very little of the shit.

The poor, the lower caste and marginalized groups suffer through constant shit from their government, from their neighbours, from their communities, from those above them. 


Life truly is hell for a lot of people here, people who haven't lived here or experienced it first hand would have a hard time understanding this >Furthermore, people here are quite ignorant of other cultures - I know several people who don't know what the Mexican flag looks like despite it being our neighbor


Half the dumb fucks in this country don't know that north eastern states are a part of India. This sub reddit is one of the most sane pages on the internet and has people discussing real problems of this country. People from this page don't live in a bubble. Compared to US, yes. Even basic necessities become a problem in India. In my parents' place in Mumbai there's water available only for 2 hours in morning and 2 hours in evening. In my brother's place in Bangalore power cuts happen quite frequently.

This is just the bare minimum, basic necessity and even that is not easily completed. And these are in major cities in India ffs. No way you can even think of comparing India with US when shit like this happens.  Bas aake subah mumbai local pakadke college/office jake dikha, fir dekh kaise saari ""desh bhakti"" nikal jayegi. It's honestly a matter of perspective. I grew up in India and currently live in US.

If you compare India with US, UK or France, then, yeah, of course, there are enormous differences, not just in terms of money, but also lifestyle and personal liberties.

But then, one of my uncles was in Libya and his life was turned upside down because of the revolution - life is unpredictable, although people put on a brave face and carry on as usual.

I visited Budapest, where there was bullet holes and shell-holes in the middle of the city where tanks entered the streets during World War II, and later on Anti-Soviet civil war.

When I see some Indians whining about their country not being good enough,  or claiming that a dictatorship or radical political upheaval is needed, I want to bitchslap them.

Honestly, we take peace, prosperity and economic growth for granted in India. 

Even if you are in United States, if you go Switzerland, Monaco, Sweden or Denmark, you will feel like United States is backwoods. But if you visit Sudan, Ukraine or El Salvador, you'll realize things you take for granted. NO [deleted] > Perhaps I'm spoiled. I know that many of the luxuries I have here would be difficult to attain in India, but honestly I'd rather have more of a taste of the personal freedom I have felt there than the material objects I have here.


To this, I say the system works somewhat in America.The system does not work in India.You want to go to the Corporation to get a civic problem sorted, the system does not work. You want to go to the cops to get an issue sorted out, the system does not work.You want to go to the court to get legal issues sorted out, the system does not work.

We are sick and tired of having a system that does not work for the common man And here I am trying to leave this **** country after finishing my college!😥 This kid is sheltered af lol


OP are you a Patel by any chance ? The grass really is greener on the other side. Plus you being financially well off and privileged wouldn't be exposed to the pain and suffering the poor and downtrodden go through India is good but Indian people are bad. I mean really, really bad. They're rude, selfish, arrogant, you name it Fine that's true - india is definitely more humane than the US. so go to India and work. Ya do that shitty job with a shitty boss, but you will find good people too.  Indians have a decently good life most of the time. But unlike in Western countries, when something goes wrong, they can start whining about the ""system"".

A big chunk of frustration comes from ""I saw F.R.I.E.N.D.S and I want that life"" attitude. Sure India has many problems but the untethered frustration in this sub is quite silly. I live in EU with colleagues from Germany, Switzerland etc. All of them are also frustrated with their politics and society in general. But they don't imagine a fairy tale land somewhere else and whine. Indians do. That's the only difference.  You will be better off as top 1%ile in India than top income 5%ile in US.

With significantly low minimum wage and lax labour regulatory environment you can afford hell lot more services than in US. But this cuts other way as well, you are more prone to get unhygienic food even in top end restaurants.

I am not sure what you mean when you say you can’t do some stuff in India what you can do in states. You bet. It's a hell hole. Poverty increases religiousness of human(tribes worship extra curvy piece of driftwood and whatnot). This is what politicians benefit from. Be it Hindu or Muslim, overly religious people are easy to manipulate. Thus, all the politics revolves around religious sentiments of its voters. This is why education is least concern of government, they want to keep the voters uneducated and poor, hence increasing their religious beliefs, keeping them dumb and easy to sway. 

So, yes, it is as bad as they come. However, on a positive note, things are changing quite a lot as people are realising how the politicians play with them and use them. Hope things will only get better. Hey, what Dubai is like? "
Police/Economy,Can I get my passport renewed with an address in a different city?,26,apfw4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/apfw4v/can_i_get_my_passport_renewed_with_an_address_in/,14,1549917786.0,"If my permanent address is in Calcutta, can I get my passport renewed in Mumbai by showing my home in Calcutta?

I have already had police verification done at the same address in Calcutta for my last passport. 

As per this [link](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/big-relief-now-apply-for-passport-from-anywhere-in-india/story/279605.html), it mentions that this is possible. But the people at the passport helpline say that they have no idea about this and it is not possible. Has anyone over here done this successfully before?

Thanks!",thetruegenji," Trust me avoid this. Police of station to another don't co-operate, how can you expect one state to another, that too for a petty passport. Nowadays passport renewal is very easy, just fill form online. Take pains to travel to your hometown for a day during your meeting in passport office, its the easiest way. My recommendation is to avoid this if you are far from your home city (which is true in this case) and you cannot make it to police verification in your home city. You can get fucked pretty hard with a ₹5000 fine and that too I they find your explanation satisfactory. 

Apply with your Mumbai address as present and Kolkata as permanent.  RemindMe! 1 day No 

That's not how it works I think.  Tried to do what you are trying, ended up paying 5k as a fine, so please if you are not changing permanent address, it's quite simple and time bound. They have to report back with your status in a fixed number of days. So try getting your local address passport and keep older one as permanent. I've gotten my India passport renewed from Singapore. Passport still mentions India address as permanent address.  RemindMe! 1 day Yea, I believe the rules were changed recently "

",-0-1-," Thanks!! [deleted] Good job. Thanks for sharing OP. This needs to be upvoted more. holy cow...i'll have to tldr.
This is what's gonna happen when you pair poor computer literacy, lazy programmers, old cyber infrastructure , fake pateriotism and lack of will for security of public.  We need a wikipedia page for AAdhaar leaks . There are so many of them .  [removed] Thanks a lot man. I have such links just in case I need to slap something my friends with and I don't have it. Having so many of them on a topic at one place is a lot of help. 

Someone should make a list of all fuck ups of modi.  God damn. fuck.   How can I help? I am an experienced web developer.

Perhaps an interactive site or forum or both. People might like to explore this too: r/antiaadhar had to scroll 5 times to get bottom of this! That's a lot of work.
Thnx brah Thanks, this is much needed. Aadhar is being misused by the govt in big way. Does anyone maintain a google drive to store all news articles related to adhaar? Saved Wow ! Top quality content OP! this should be stickied Holy fuck!! [removed] cool Articles can be deleted from websites, no?

We should save it as PDFs! Yes thank you man. This is just what I was thinking about that if someone ever asks for proof about shittyness of Aadhar, this is it. Even the UIDAI would shut their mouths. You the real nigga! 🤘🏻 Nice u/-0-1-

 OP, add this map too

Thank you for this social service.

May the blinds see it clear. Is there a way to make this list so that it is  the headlines  hyperlinked to the website. Will make the list more shareable online that way as it will be more readable. I only know of a manual way to do it. Ok"
Police/Economy,Why are so many Indians eager to leave India?,231,6sbho5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6sbho5/why_are_so_many_indians_eager_to_leave_india/,443,1502199371.0,"Im not here to start a flame war, but I would simply like an honest, open discussion. When I visited Salt Lake city, so many indian americans who converted to mormon christians were ashamed to admit they were from India.

Why do you think so many Indians are so eager to leave India for ""greener pastures"", like Canada, USA, Europe?Why cant we make India a better place to live so that we don't have such a bad brain drain and lose of valuable human capital? Is it overpopulation? Extremism? Bad goverment? Bad police? Bad economy?",Lotus_towers," India's net outward migration rate is actually quite low. It's just that there are *so many* Indians that in absolute numbers, it's a lot. This leads people to think that everyone is fleeing India, while in reality it's a small amount of people.

Furthermore, most of the people (permanently) emigrating tend to be from the top 15% of the population. They also tend to congregate in a few countries, notably the English-speaking ones. (I'm not counting the gulf states as those are seasonal workers and not permanent immigrants). This gives an impression that there's more of them in the world than is actually the case.

I'm just pointing this out to remind people that most of the people they talk to about emigration is a very self-selected crowd and far from representative of India. >  overpopulation? Extremism? Bad goverment? Bad police? Bad economy?

You already answered the question
 Are you seriously asking this question?Where I currently reside, the son of an elected official cannot kidnap my daughter with impunity. I have lived in India my whole life except for short trips abroad for work & leisure. The things that frustrate me about India and sometimes makes me contemplate leaving are :-

Zero Civic Sense among people - We invented 0, so we proudly embrace it. No sense of flow of traffic or cleanliness or queuing. People driving on both sides of the roads, lane changing without any concern for other traffic, loud incessant honking just because they have a horn, road rage - it frustrates the hell out of me. My biggest gripe about living in India is the 40 minute drive to and fro work every day. I HATE THE FUCKING TRAFFIC IN INDIA, it seems like I am fighting every moment am driving.

Eat Pan, spit on road ! Eat chips throw wrapper on road ! Drink water, piss on road ! It's disgusting. Animal lurking on roads and defecating openly leaving smells and bio-hazards everywhere.

Railway station, Bus Station, Airport... what the fuck is a queue ? 

Government Apathy - Roads, clean water, uninterrupted electricity supply, hassle free business policies, things we can only dream of.  Okies. I might be able to partly answer this. 

I moved to the states for my education. I'll list reasons why I moved (albeit on a non-immigrant F1 visa, I'm definitely planning on staying back after graduation)

1) Better education. I know IIT's and other top institutions are objectively better than many US universities but average US university >>>>>> Indian college. I couldn't make it in JEE and got into a good college w/ full scholarship with a less work compared to JEE prep. And the research, campus environment, professors, rules (plagiarism is literally suicide in the US and in most colleges here don't even have that concept). I'm not shittalking and being a snob but my dad worked as HOD in a reputable engineering college and even he says from his first hand experience about educational opportunities here vs abroad. 

2) Better living standards. Again not being a prick but standards are objectively better in the west. I mean sure elite of Mumbai will probably lead a better lifestyle compared to some guy in rural Alabama but comparing the median its hands off. 

3) Job opportunities. Again no brainier for a few fields in my opinion. 

4) I'm going to sound like an ass but Kulcha dude. I mean yeah America and other countries do have their own share of nuts who are just plain assholes but there are subtle nuances which make me feel better off in the US (for example I'm working 20 hours a week in the US as a freshman which pays for my living expenses and other bills, which I could never imagine happening in India --be it social awkwardness and being looked down upon or simply the opportunity to work as a student with flexible hours and great pay--)

But yeah it isn't all rosy. It's still shit ton expensive to live here. The healthcare situation is a mess. The gun control issue is always scary. The h1b visa thing is a pain in the ass and can screw me over anytime. And other shall day to day problems. 

 To keep it short and simple: Everybody likes India, but nobody likes Indians. My main reason for leaving is that I am a private person and Indian society in general does not respect personal space. Even today my most common reaction to Indian news, or events is...""but that is none of your business...""

To add to that was my chosen profession. At the time I left, there were absolutely 0 places in India that did what I wanted to do, at sophistication levels that were internationally competitive.

Not to mention that 10 years ago, I was earning a stipend as a student here that is 1.5x the gross salary of an average Indian engineer. It wasn't a cakewalk living as a student, but much better than what I would have had at that st/age in India.

Contrary to what movies show, I do not miss India. I miss my parents and family. But since they are mobile and can visit, and I travel to India every year at least, that is not really a problem.

At this point, I have reached a stage where I have no incentive to go to India. Why would I...when I am living at better standards, good job satisfaction and missing nothing? And when I do visit India, I'll tell you...India is an absolute pleasure and blast if you arrive with a lot (relatively speaking) of money.

The problem is not the country. Unfortunately, the beautiful Himalayas and the Taj  and the pristine national parks do not dictate my day to day experiences. It's the masses who have decided that rationality and intellectualism is not important. Therefore my views do not align with the masses there. If I came there with my views, I would probably be told to leave anyway. Most people would probably see me as an arrogant narcissistic NRI just because I do not share their irrational views on what should or shouldn't be considered offensive. 

So in the end, I am more of a foreigner in my janma-bhoomi than my karma-bhoomi. So, speaking from experience it's mostly the fact that there is  far too much resistance to change and inability from the majority to listen to ideas and thoughts that contradict their way of thinking or customs. We've gone backwards in terms of thoughts and customs and the general populous has embraced this as a good thing. Apart from the whole standard of living and healthcare I think these are some of the problems, might be wrong. Americans can create comedy shows shitting on the current POTUS, who wants to be a dictator, without any fear of reprisals while Indians get arrested for writing an FB post complaining about the extravagant funeral of a regional leader.

Edit: a typo [deleted] 1. Quality of life: No power cuts, no problems with water supply, no trouble with parking. 

2. Better infrastructure: Better roads, better planned facilities for walking, jogging & outdoor activities.

3. Affordibility of housting: An average house with a nice front lawn & backyard in a normal US city (not in Silicon Valley or NYC) costs about USD 250-350k, which works out to 2-2.5 years of salary for an engineer. In a city like Bangalore, a decent apart by the side of a toxic lake like Bellandur lake in Bangalore goes for 1 Crore (160k USD). How many years of salary of an average engineer is that?

4. Education of kids: In a city like Bangalore, education of your grade schooler is around 1 lakh per year at least at a good school. In US, public schooling is free. (Please don't jump on me saying government schools are free in India too. No middle class person would put their wards in a government school after looking at what facilities they provide)

5. Peace of Mind: Ever seen the average traffic in any of our big cities? 

6. Policing & Courts which function: The law enforcement in US works. Unlike our courts, the cases aren't dragged for 30-40 years there. You have recourses. You don't have to bribe your local Thanedar just for him to register an FIR

7. Meritocricy: If you belong to general category, your children are screwed because of reservation. 

8. Corruption: Need anything to be said about India? 


Can go on & on. I lived in US for over a decade & then came back to India 6 years ago. I have been disillusioned. It might seem patriotic to 'stay in India & better the country' while you are a 20 year old with no obligations. Once you near 40 with a family to support, you start thinking about how you are going to support your dependants. You start comparing yourself to your peers who went abroad & now have big homes, drive fancier cars than you & have a better lifestyle than you. Patriotism goes out the window. [deleted] Financial independence and getting away from mummy/daddy.

I've lived a good life and I wouldn't be able to maintain my lifestyle for Rs 30-40 k per month staying in India. In developed countries your salary will pay for your rent, bills and lifestyle. 

Don't want brain drain? I don't see how that's possible. Salaries would have to increase 10 fold for people who have the option to go abroad, to even consider staying in India. End of the day, I think it's more about money than anything else.  No dalaal for getting shit done at Govt office. Because someone who can go abroad and have a better life doesn't owe the people who stay here anything. Expecting skilled people to stay back to ""make India a better place"" is like expecting an entire class to accept the marks of the least scoring student.

As far as Mormons go, they seek members pretty actively and are often a close community . Indians trying who convert probably get a lot of help setting up. May be people are generally frustrated. And we are not trained to participate in democracy. We still believe in mai-baap sarkar. There has to be reciprocation, When you love country, it has to love you back, and we have to have rule of law and peace. We don't have to bribe to get our legitimate work done. Even one paise bribe is an insult on us. There has to be demand for progress in science and basic needs like housing and healthcare. As these does not exist here, it is better to leave. Just have to say as an ABCD the level of anti-India posts in this thread is simply amazing. You would think India is freaking Syria or Venezuela from these posts.  When you see

- middle class burdened with all kinds of taxes
- reservation, your kids won't get fair chance
- gov making your life difficult for no apparent logical reason
- you earn less and pay more taxes just to compensate for general lack of efficiency in system
- if you get in trouble, you need either power or lot of money and if don't have it, you won't get justice. And it can happen anytime

 .. you feel cheated One word answer to a serious question: Population !!

Too many people chasing too few resources... Too many frustrated dreams and ambitions due to limited resources etc etc.... You name it, the root cause is the same: A billion people crowding the 7th largest nation on earth.  Quality of work and life.  See YouTube India's trending page. It'll explain everything for you > Is it overpopulation? Extremism? Bad goverment? Bad police? Bad economy?

Yeap. There was a post a while back about some dude who thought that Canada was a shittier place to live than India. I responded and it kind of fits here so here it is:
> You must be joking   
Let's compare sensibly. Op didn't mention anything about Canada's social safety net, which is massive. Free health care. An actual minimum wage. Standard of living. Safety. Modern conveniences.  
I don't know wtf the guy is talking about, but banking in Canada is 100x easier and more efficient than India.  
Yes, Telecom is very expensive in Canada. But it's a bit unfair to compare it to India , which has some of the lowest Telecom in the world.   
Streets have their own flavour. It's obviously not the same as Bombay, but you must be blind if you can't have fun in Toronto or Vancouver.
The multiculturalism in metro cities in Canada can't be matched by anywhere in India.  
**Being surrounded by mostly decent, self aware people in Canada is 10000x better than the dog-eat-dog mentality of Mumbai.**  
There are people who smoke weed and watch Netflix, and there others who go camping , skiing, hiking, mountain climbing, whatever. Like in any other city.
Sure there are people in an existential mental crisis in Canada, but there are a hell of a lot of more people fighting for their next meal in India.
You have to be retarded to think that Toronto, in general, is a shittier place to live than Mumbai. Obviously anecdotally there are people happier in one city than the other, but there is a reason Canada is a G7 country.


and in another post


>I didn't mean to shit on Mumbai. The OP post was silly and the person i was responding to said that it was ""on the money"" and mentioned Bombay specifically. I was just, loosely going through the points that i could remember. Like someone else said, he was comparing the 1% in Mumbai (maybe even the 0.1%?) to the average person's life in Canada. Even then, i'd choose Canada, hands down - i was talking to my dad and he was talking about how he can have 2 drivers, 3 servants etc in India while in canada i would have to clean my own house and wash my own car. He's right, but i'd give it all up for the civility that a lot of other places have. [removed] Caste is king bruh. Period. That guy honking in the traffic non stop.. arrgghh!

 I aint gonna speak to him, I will leave India. The answer is there in ur question aka ""greener pastures""

Obviously there is more money to be made in all job sectors (not just IT related).  It's *always* overpopulation.
In Indias case it's overpopulation in poverty - nuke in an erupting volcano. To address what you mentioned, not all of us convert to Mormon Christians, you know. Some of us are born Christians. Also there are many of us who are not ashamed to admit we're from India.  For me, I moved to USA because of insane pollution in Delhi. The pollution was so bad that I would always have a bad throat, dry eyes, get out of breath walking up 2-3 floors. Looking at people around me, I used to feel that I had lost some genetic lottery and this how it will be for the rest of my life. I was on anti-allergics and antibiotics for pretty much whole year. Which, if you don't know, causes massive long term issues.

All that changed when I moved to USA last year. All my symptoms are gone, haven't taken any medicine since I moved here. I can take stair to 5th without getting out of breath. It is such a huge relief. 

These days, I am terrified of going back to India, even to visit for a week. Because India's a shithole? Seriously how is this even a question? If you're asking me specifically,
1)Freedom of speech
2)Reservations
3)standard of living 
4)much less competition
If I ever have kids, I don't want them to suffer here. Overpopulation and the fact that most of them garbage human beings.  1. Higher income -  

2. Better quality of living      

  2.1 better quality of living comes from better infrastructure - you don't need to struck in traffic that is filled with smoke, honking complete Chaos everyday to work.

 2.2 no bribery or discrimination. 

 2.3 unemployment support in case you are permanant resident in countries like USA.

 2.4 Best configured apartments/ homes and fully equipped automobiles. Even the standard automobile camry you drive in USA, is considered luxury in India.

3. Social status - living abroad makes you better person as per many Indian families  as they see your face once in a while at family functions.

4.  If you are girl the amount of freedom you get is close to infinity. People don't call you names if you drink, smoke and get a tattoo.

5. Customer service is great. You can find the best products with great service, that is hard to find in India. Noice b8 m8 I'm an ABCD so my parents left India long ago. I think part of the reason is that Indians have low self esteem about India. They think India and the world is as it was 20-30 years ago when India didn't have a middle class and living in the US or western world was significantly different. But now you can have a pretty decent middle class life with western crap in India, there is a big middle class and growing fast. 

People also watch Hollywood movies and are fed lots of BS about the US from other Indians who moved. They view it as a brand name, regardless of the facts. It's ironic to me that the US has pretty massive political problems. It very easily could spend the next 10-20 years just having massive social and political issues that eventually leak into the economic arena and destroy the entire country. 

But people are blind to this. Brainwashed. It's very sad, India isn't perfect but it's an ancient civilization and growing fast. You cannot turn your back on that. It's also sad that it's the educated class that wants (or can) leave, if the top 1-2% of the smartest ppl leave that really hinders any nation's development. Imagine if the top 2% of Americans left, what would happen to the economy. 

Also, I don't think Indians understand what US culture is like, particularly raising kids. They are going to lose their Indian culture and deal with insane amounts of racism you cannot even comprehend. By your grandkids generation they won't even think they are Indian. US culture is basically about money and individualism, it is not very healthy if you care about traditional values. Overall I don't find most Americans happy. You need family, community, culture, etc to be happy. 

So overall people have no clue.  Why don't we make this a Monthly Thread? We can wine about the problems and the consolations people give about the people in India. I fucking hate this thread frequently coming up on Randia's trending page! > Why cant we make India a better place to live

Well I used to go clean up the trash and washed up Ganpati idols on Mumbai beaches after Visarjan and then had to hear my friends making fun of me because I wanted to the next Gandhi.

I could not handle the abject poverty, used to live near a slum and had half naked kids clinging to my feet begging for money. I have literally have spent countless nights thinking how can I fix the system.

I hate the fact that Indians dont see themselves as Indians first, language has higher priority than country.

Had to get away from super religious parents, India is not a good place for atheists.

Wanted to explore other countries and cultures.

In the end I took the easy way out and got out. I don't know. Maybe look around you? That's a good place to start. I have lived here for a total of 7 years (18 now, planning on going to Canada) And here's why I want to leave:

1) Un-safe and Un-clean. Every other day you here about someone being kidnapped, raped, killed or worse( idk what's worse than death but lolz). The hygiene thing speaks for itself. I can count on ONE hand the places I've been to that were decently cleaned, and I've travelled across India.

2) Close mindedness and backwards thinking. Especially in the school system. Although I'm doing IB, so I'm not in a school where this is very prevalent (thank fuck), but it's there. I was asked to cut my hair because I looked like a girl. Then I'm asked to shave because I look raggedy. Teachers/students see me sitting/talking to a girl they get all conservative. We can't bring our phones to school. For a country that's striving to be like the US, these small things add up. Oh and that brings me to my next point:


3) Trying way too hard to be western. You see so many idiots at comic cons and shit just because a lot of people in America do this. I'm not assuming this- I was told this. by multiple people. Trying way too hard to follow trends on social media/youtube by just being pretentious af.

4) So many fake people. Literally everyone sucks each other's dicks when they're around but as soon as they leave, they start bitching about how shit that person is. **EVERYONE does this. Don't deny it**

5) Sensitivity. Seriously, people get **so damn butthurt** at fucking EVERYTHING. Take the stick out of your ass, chill. NOBODY I've met here has thick skin, and they definitely don't know how to take jokes well. And for someone who has a dark sense of humor, that's honestly a bit sad. You even see these everywhere on social media, some guy says an honest thing about this country, and Immediately is fucked in the ass by a bajillion people. Stop ignoring your problems and put *our* country on a fucking pedestal, guys. This place is broken and any attempt to fix it is being denied/ignored.


6) Lack of awareness to other stuff. I lived here for 5 years before, then came back in 2015. I remembered hindi, but not too well, because I spoke marathi with my parents. My first year, people were making fun of me and literally laughing their asses off when I spoke in hindi, and made fun of my accent when I spoke english. WHAT LANGUAGE DO YOU WANT ME TO SPEAK IN THEN? thankfully, I learned to sound decent when I spoke hindi by imitating the other guys, but I still get smirks and giggles when people hear me speak english. This fucks with my head so much that I barely speak.



There's a lot more but honestly these got me worked up.
 better work culture and environment One life is all we have. What's wrong in exploring the ""greener pastures"" if you can.  $$$ > Why cant we make India a better place to live

Because there are just too many of us. Resources are less, the people who want to use the resources are much more. It's a rat race for even basic survival. I really have no clue why population control isn't on anyone's list of things to do something about.  Lack of opportunity, lack of law and order, lack of justice......lack of cleanliness, lack of healthcare, lack of diversity of thought, so many reasons. because hinduism is a f***** up religion that is majority here and is the main reason for everything wrong with this country but yet when you try to explain that to indians they try to blame their failings and weakness on everything other than Hinduism like invaders, islam or even academia and sink deeper into the abyss. Maybe one day Islam or Christianity will take over and our nation can be as good as western nations but that day seems far with the attitude of Indians. So many **South** Indians. Because India is a third world country?  [deleted] In today's India it's not a bad place to live. Cities like Bangalore , Pune , Mumbai , Delhi offer u all the facilities available in any other countries. Yeah poverty and quality education is a problem because of the huge population. As whole I personally have seen a great deal of change in the government organisations interms of their work ethics and the private companies in India can be regarded as good as any other place in the world or is almost developing towards it. People leaving india for further studies and research might have increased but it's because the facilities of education and research are better in other countries and not because they don't want to live in this country. Moving abroad does not mean moving to us I could be moving to Pakistan or Russia or China.

And because India poplulation vs the rest of the world population and u can't change Indians that impossible. 

So it's better to move to a place than stay here and try to change people.

I just want a peaceful simple life where I can do what ever I want. Not that I have to worry that if some corrupted politician wants to fuck my live over they can in India. 

India is too much competitive and it's going backwards. Very very quoraesque, check it there, it'll have this answer in under 800 words. In one simple statement: India is fucked up on so many levels. Having said this it doesn't mean India doesn't have much of good thing.. It does. And in the larger scheme of things still a fucked up country. You name a thing, India will find a reason to fuck up Ugh here we go again with this same old circlejerk discussion. 

If you've lived in or even heard of both places, you'd know the pros and cons of each. 

What you consider better or worse would be a very subjective opinion.  Because I am tired of cobbling together a precarious system/bubble that works and because there are better opportunities for me to advance my career abroad.  It is a fucked up country with no real opportunity but slavery for other 1st world countries. Indians never made a jack shit in their low lives that they can be proud of and sell it to the world except for bullshit. Problem is not the system, it is the people who created this system because they are too stupid to understand the big picture. And to top it all, the Hinduism is the worst thing which is the doom of this nation, hence it is followed only in India and no where else. The world knows how backward and tomfoolery that is, hence the progressive nations are moving forward with single agenda that is to not become a world market to sell goods but not buy anything from it. It has made them greedy, lazy and out of control loonies who are living to die everyday but not survive. It's all toxic and dirt everywhere and they are not even embarrassed about it.

To walk in a clean 1st world country is 100 times better than being patriotic which means nothing in reality but slogans and feelers. That's not enough and that will never change. When there are disagreements in a family, the sane person always walks out to leave all the shit behind. Similarly, Indians will never change, so better leave them in their own pile of shit and walk away. Because we are kaam-chor and lazy. Define ""so many""? Depends on who you ask. Most of the outward migration happens from around 15-20% of the country's population which can afford it.

Some leave for better economic opportunities and a higher standard of living, then there is the whole brain drain thing, where qualified professionals also don't have the kind of jobs they seek here.

The stifling culture is a reason for some as well, although Indians take the backwardness with them wherever they go, in my experience.  It is seen as a natural career progression with better pay and supposedly better life. (work in India, get enough money/loan to do MS in US, snag a job, get H1B and enjoy elevated social status) . 

Also, many women do it to escape from parents. I think its for better job opportunities and money. Otherwise, nobody wants to move out of his native place. The culture in US is very different and I have not seen many Indians who have fully embraced it. Also, like every other country, US has its own share of problems. 

I don't know why some Indians are ashamed of their ancestral roots. US is very diverse and apart from very few people (~1%), all other guys are pretty accommodating. In early years of college, I had this campus job in library. I had very thick accent and even then nearly everyone assumed that I was american. I think most of them don't even know about India very much.  - Aspiration of a better life.

- Expectation of a better lifestyle

- Promise of better (and high paying) jobs

- Better infrastructure in most developed nations

- Freedom from family pressure/ societal norms

- Possibility of getting an absolutely fresh start (in life).

These are some of the reasons that I could think of. People tend to migrate to other countries depending on their situations, aspirations, needs and wants.

Their reason(s) to migrate could be one, or a choice of multiple options stated above (and also some reasons, that I must have skipped). >so many indian americans who converted to mormon christians 

OP, can u please put some more light on why they converted? Mormon Christian, for real?  The sheer task of getting Indians to behave. It's impossible. It's better to leave.  People converted to mormons? Probably liked their polygamy advantages. More pussy is always good. We need a pew research to answer your question accurately. 

ITT it's all anecdotal.  It's a lot easier to run from problems than to solve them, and India has a *lot* of problems
 Because its a shit place to live, work and even start a family.

Like real shit. I think corruption was the biggest reason until 3 years ago. Now its just religious extremism. This is a vicious cycle and there is no shying away from it.  I too don't want to live in India. Give me some way to go abroad with very less money *Advantages :*

**1. Economy** : Price of a house is higher in India. For roughly similar urban area the price per sq ft of land around (3-4k per sqft). With a middle class income of 50k per month it is like 12 sq ft per month of work.

In the US it is like 400k for 2000 sq ft house = 200$/sqft. This means more like 25-30 sqft per month on an average salary of 5-5.5k. Similar is true of agricultural land and rural land as well.

The main difference stems from the fact that in India only urban areas are as developed as some semi urban areas in the developed world. The rural areas of India are completely off the grid.

**2. Rule of law and women's freedom** : It is arguably better in the west. They are at least earnest about it. Many feel freer from society's grips when they come abroad. For ex: Single men, single women, muslims, dalit non vegetarians find it harder to rent apartments and even hotels sometimes. Let's not even get started on why many queers would love to escape the country first chance they get.

**3. Earn in $ spend in Rs.** : Because India has a trade deficit with the world INR will be weak. This means if you earn in $ and spend in Rs you are making an easy buck. The PPP is 3 times lower in India vs US. Money moves freely from US to India without tax.

**4. Multiculturalism** : India's huge advantage is that it is the indian subcontinents multicultural hub where every culture thrives. Some areas of the west like the US take it to the next level and have global multiculturalism.

**5. High tech :** Some high tech jobs are available only in the west. The cost of human labor and growth potential is higher for an individual

*Disadvantages :*

**Racism :** You will always be a minority in the west. Nowadays even a somewhat unwelcome minority.

**Culture :** It is likely that if u stay a long time most remnants of your original Indian culture and roots will slowly vanish.

**Glass ceiling** : There is a glass ceiling for most Indian immigrants. It's very hard for them to grow beyond a certain level. For ex: Very hard to enter politics, law, sports, hollywood etc.

*Outlook*

One of the key things is that India is growing rapidly and improving rapidly. This means more opportunities for everyone to participate in the growth. Better rule of law and so on. Basically in the near future it will make less and less sense to get out. It might even mean that it would be foolish for people not to return to India and participate in its growth story. 

PS: These are my personal views based on what I have read, having lived in India for most of my life, living in US for the past one year. Feel free to disagree and state why! * Reservations - I think I deserve more than what I can get in India.

* Respect in workplace - I have not experience people in power looking down upon others. My efforts and skills are respected. I feel valued.

* Violence - I can say fuck Jesus and will not be beaten up here.

* Democracy - When Lalu Yadav was in power in Bihar, my parents were routinely not allowed to vote. They were turned away from poll booths. I have little hope/concern with Indian politics now.

* Family - Extended family are all assholes. I have no connection to them.

* Less discrimination(maybe) - I moved to Delhi because the children of my parent's colleagues were getting kidnapped in Patna. Got used to the Bihar-hate early on. I have not faced that kind of antagonism here.

It was easy to move for me. I have no stake in India.

I would like India to succeed and be the best possible version of itself. I do not know why I care though. Travel is good for the mind, challenges your perspective, makes you see positives about where you're from as well as the bad. I've immigrated a few times, once because I had to for work but after that I just enjoyed change. I have a brother who has lived in over ten different countries, although now he has come home to settle down and so his kids can go to university.  Easy to change your situation than change the situation around you.  All of it? Greener pastures sums it up well Firstly,outward Migration from India in terms of percentage is quite low. We have a lot of people and therefore even a small percentage of migration is big in terms of absolute numbers.

Secondly,I don't know as to why you bring in Mormon Christianity into the conversation because migration often has nothing to do with Religion in the case of India. Many Hindus and Sikh Americans might be ashamed of India as well.

The reasons can be-

1) Better Economic Prospects (I.e Better jobs)
2) Better Education and research opportunities (My uncle says that although Research prospects in India are improving, it's nowhere even near the west)
3) Sexual Orientation (Rare but still)
4) To escape the Caste System (Idk how valid this is, probably hypothesising).


There is some Religious Angle in Migrations from India. Goan Christians tend to migrate to Portugal due to their Religious Affiliation. Goan Christians connect their ancestral traditions with Portugal because their surnames were actually the surnames of the saints who made them convert to Christianity. So they have some affection towards their Mother state. Apart from that, Religion plays no role. I think most of them explained why Indians want to leave. Sorry for hijacking the thread.,

Considering the present situation in US and few other countries, which is best country to move? Our old folks are way too judgemental. I'll be back when the old generation's gone to kingdom come. less about leaving India, more about exploring the world Because of our inferiority complex. We have grown up on history text books with large chapters devoted to the Mughals and the British but only passing mentions of the huge Vijayanagar empire, the Marathas, Guptas, Mauryas etc. Our media (and foreign media) projects us to be rapists and murderers while per capita crime rates are actually far huger in the so-called developed nations. We have been taught that to know and talk English is to be 'aristocratic'. If you have been taught to constantly hate on India and everything India, why would you continue living in India?  > When I visited Salt Lake city, so many indian americans who converted to mormon christians were ashamed to admit they were from India.

Bullshit.  According to the 2010 census, there are approximately 6200 Indian-Americans living in the State of Utah. Furthermore, only about 1% of Mormons are Asian-Americans. Given these stats, I find it hard to believe you will actually meet ""so many"" Desis who have converted to Mormonism. Don't have to believe what I wrote, here are the sources for the numbers.

Police/Economy,Should prostitution and red light areas be legalized in India?,153,7lzlsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7lzlsj/should_prostitution_and_red_light_areas_be/,75,1514205899.0,"Just another morning rant. The irony of our country is that almost everyone knows that red light areas exist, and probably many visit them too. Yet, they do it secretly since the law does not allow it, and it is also a social stigma for some.

Though prostitution isn't illegal itself, the police has a bunch of laws that fall under the umbrella of ""Immoral Trafficing"" (अनैतिक व्यवसाय in hindi/marathi) through which they make it illegal. Problem is that these laws have resulted in increased human trafficing into our country from other poor regions like Nepal, Bangladesh, etc. instead of solving any problem. Those who have visited red light areas very well know that the police doesn't actually implement these laws, they just want to extract as much as possible from the businesses of brothel owners and sex workers. The real victims in this case happen to be those poor and innocent girls (mostly underage children) who are smuggled into India from neighboring countries.

By making red light areas legal, we will be solving multiple problems at once:

1. Sex workers will no longer need to be smuggled from other regions as many in India will be willing to do that trade since its legal.
2. Number of rapes and molestations will drastically go down (even hard-core pervs won't do that if they are getting what they want by legal means).
3. Corruption will decrease - cops won't extract anything from sex workers since what they are doing is legally accepted.
4. Employment generation - From a pure economics perspective, its a win-win if more employment is generated in the economy.
5. Progressive culture - Sex workers are currently viewed in a very bad light in some sections of our society. Its debatable that whether this attitude has resulted in the legal framework that prohibits immoral trafficing, or its the other way round and people view them as bad because of the laws. In either case, the stigma associated with the sex workers should drastically come down if the law accepts them with open arms.

Let me tell you that we are not the first country to have done this. Liberal nations like Norway and Sweden already did this and are experiencing all the listed benefits of legalizing prostitution. It will be really great if India does such a thing in future. Its possible, we only need to get united and explain to the law makers and society that how beneficial its going to be. 

Merry Christmas to you All. Jai Hind!

**Edit**

This news just broke on ABP few minutes earlier:

https://twitter.com/abpnewstv/status/945216544329494528

This pimp was arrested before on charges of trafficking minor girls into India, then gets a bail and goes scott free. Now years later, she is again held yesterday for the exact same charge (immoral trafficking)! These incidents will stop happening if the need for trafficking girls itself finishes due to legalization of red light areas.",asoka_maurya," Yes, it must be legal in every state with the good atmosphere. Surely to protect from HIV.  It should be legalized, but it should be regularized by the government. 

Seeing how corrupt the government and how immoral our politicians are I'm sure most of the fucktards we elect as our leaders will only exploit it for their own gains. 

If I'm wrong it's legal in Bangladesh and conditions of brothels are pathetic. Legalization doesn't really guarantee the safety of women.

For India to be like the Netherlands we must change the mindsets of the people living in the country; that's the real battle.   Being a prostitute is legal in India. While this sounds good in theory, there is a very thin line to walk between allowing women to make money of sex and preventing exploitation of women who will be forced into it or trafficked into it.

Today, women trafficked into it have the legal option to be rescued from trafficking because it is illegal, by authorities and NGOs.If it is legalized, a few hands will be greased by pimps and authorities will be ""convinced"" no one in the flesh trade is there against their will.

If there is really an attempt to allow women to make money off the skin trade without exploitation, a strip bar will be a suitable opening salvo Yes, of course.  BTW, **[the US state of Nevada also has legal prostitution](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/downtown/prostitution-in-nevada-has-its-advantages-experts-say/)**. Rebuttal for point 2: Weinstein

Rebuttal for point 3: restaurants Yes, Swiggy & OLA can explore new areas. Introduce sex robots. No chance of human trafficking. It should be, I agree. However you are approaching this from a supply and demand angle and assuming people will behave logically.

The number of sex related crimes will not go down until we understand the core issue that drives rapes and the possessive/stalkerish behaviour. Its about power and humiliation. Going by your logic, considering there's such a dizzying amount of porn available for free, why are people recording rapes and using them as a threat? Or why is it that there are gangs of predators preying on solitary victims? Lets not confuse a garden variety perv/groper/voyeur with a rapist. 

A client with a yen for blonde, blue eyed women, who's ready to pay big bucks, is not going to be ok with some fair skinned bottle blonde desi woman. What happens if a pimp can't get hold of a willing woman?

Money mate, money. Someone in the sex trade with free agency has control over their earnings. They might give a percentage for protection/their agency and that would be it. The very first group of people who will protest the legalization will be police and mantrijis. 

But overall, even from the angle of controlling the spread of HIV/STDs I do think it would be a good idea. Too bad a few generation of troglodytes would have to die for some thought revolution to occur. I'm all in for legalisation of prostitution but Feminist lobbies and Women commission won't make it possible.  Legal karo yaa naa karo, hum to hila k hi anand lenge Getting prostitution legalized will help government stop/control crimes related to trafficking, since these red light areas are mostly considered as trafficking hub.

Let's not forget that the women working their probably think twice before reporting any crime to the local police because of the social stigma, that might change as well. Then how will the police collect their hafta? It should be legalised for sure. Yes should be legalized and should be properly taxed.   Asking if prostitution should be legal in India is like asking should marijuana be legal. There's a silent contract between the public and the government over these things. It should be legalized with restrictions. There should be a proper inspection whether women are forced into being in that profession. But there's no way it will be legalized considering how conservative most people are. Fringe groups will start causing havoc claiming it hurts their religious sentiments. > human trafficing into our country from other poor regions like Nepal, Bangladesh, etc.

what I've been wondering is....there are huge portions of Indian population that have worse poverty than these countries with much smaller population - so no issue with supply - so why is this cross-border trafficking happening ?  YES we need political backing here any party doing this will be ocmmiting political harakiri I'm sure that idea is spreading. Banning anything does not work. People want what they want and they will get it somehow. The current idea taking shape is legalize everything, tax and govern them. > Number of rapes and molestations will drastically go down 

I never convinced of this.. Do we really believe that someone who is so desperate to commit a rape knowing well enough that things don't go well - he could land up in jail.., is not aware of how easily you can get prostitutes in India? I mean they are at major street corners every damn night, the police turn a blind eye and they can be quite cheap - based on many factors.

Rapes happen for different reasons - the need to dominate and force yourself on someone who is not available for a price.  K (a) Yes, prostitution should be legalized.

(b) No, it won't do much to improve the rape and molestation situation.

What it would do is reduce instances of child/human trafficking, STDs and horrible conditions under which the prostitutes and their children live. It works in a country like Netherlands where even the girls themselves know their rights and the police is largely non corrupt.Even then there are instances of east european women being forced into the profession due to poverty. In a country like India this will have its own challenges.

Not nitpicking, but prostitution law in Sweden has an interesting twist - it is legal for a girl to offer sex for money, but it is illegal for a guy to buy sex for money. So essentially, prostitution is illegal, with protection for the girls. Prostitution should be decriminalized, but not legalized. Pimping should be illegal. Procuring should be illegal. This way, a prostitute should not fear reporting to the police. 

Legalization is no way to guarantee against trafficking and exploitation, especially in a country with weak state capacity. [deleted] Follow the Nordic Model, legalize prostitution but make it illegal to pay for sex. That way buyers could be charged with legal offense while the victim escapes any harassment. 

Read this : https://nordicmodelnow.org/what-is-the-nordic-model/ Prostitution is legal pimping isn't  No , there's no concept of female agency here.


Things will only get worse and women will suffer even more exploitation.
And who'll step up to protect the diginity of prostitutes?
No feminism for them I can assure you. > Sex workers will no longer need to be smuggled from other regions 


False. If India were to make prostitution legal, it would be the only country in the vicinity to do so. Other countries in the same situation have not seen a drop in trafficking women because the incentive to do so only increases. See: Prostitution in Germany



> Number of rapes and molestations will drastically go down


Rape is about power. Not sex. 




> Corruption will decrease - cops won't extract anything from sex workers since what they are doing is legally accepted.


haaha



> Employment generation - From a pure economics perspective, its a win-win if more employment is generated in the economy.



Most prostitutes earn peanuts. This will not make any difference.



> Progressive culture - Sex workers are currently viewed in a very bad light in some sections of our society... the stigma associated with the sex workers should drastically come down if the law accepts them with open arms.


Social change will come from legislation, but from a different kind. Men will have to be taught that sex workers provide a service and dont ""sell"" their bodies. We will need fast track courts and greater punishment for crimes against women. This will cause a change in culture.



So while I think its good that you've brought this up, you need to look at the existing models in other countries as well as understand the reasons the problems we face in this country exist. He he as if law ‘enforcers’ give a shit about law in India. This won't solve the underlying cause of the problems that result in supression of women rights though."
Police/Economy,To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,1558060692.0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",arkoprovo1996,
Police/Economy,Do we have a system to police local embedded powers?,7,b7xfcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b7xfcr/do_we_have_a_system_to_police_local_embedded/,1,1554122404.0,"We seem to suffer from a broadly felt problem, which has evolved to become a cultural trope.

I'm convinced the problem could be reduced or solved if there was a system by which a different police force from another jurisdiction, or maybe another new category of law enforcement, could be 'sent in' as a special operation when it appears that local embedded powers are distorting justice, and the existing police is either ineffective or actively working in cahoots with them.

  
This system seems plausible from an incentives PoV: it can be created at a national level without local embedded powers getting involved, and will benefit local economies suffering from the distortion of law when it's implemented. 

  
It's possible such a system already exists, and I'm unaware of it. Or there's a reason why it wouldn't work. Do let me know.

Police/Economy,"Indian Drivers Must Learn To Respect Traffic Rules, Or Continue To Face The Consequences",25,91zspm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/91zspm/indian_drivers_must_learn_to_respect_traffic/,16,1532614902.0,"[Indian Drivers Must Learn To Respect Traffic Rules, Or Continue To Face The Consequences](https://anindianlikeyou.com/2018/07/25/indian-drivers-must-learn-to-respect-traffic-rules-or-continue-to-face-the-consequences/)

Indian drivers often show little respect for traffic rules. This has resulted in dreadful traffic conditions on Indian roads with extremely high numbers of deaths in road accidents, traffic congestions on busy roads and road rage incidents. While we may find it easy to blame the sad state of Indian traffic on poor infrastructure and the traffic police, the reality is that Indian drivers do not obey traffic rules. We need to respect traffic rules; else our traffic will only get worse.

Traffic conditions on Indian roads are deplorable. Our roads are extremely dangerous and [claim the lives of 1,50,000 people per yea](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/400-deaths-a-day-are-forcing-india-to-take-car-safety-seriously/articleshow/62439700.cms)r. This is an average of [400 people killed per day](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/400-deaths-a-day-are-forcing-india-to-take-car-safety-seriously/articleshow/62439700.cms) on our roads. In addition to hurtling grief at the bereaved families of these victims, these deaths cost India about [3% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year.](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/F9ljlqoWYdxxgJZ4razuiI/India-loses-58-billion-annually-due-to-road-accidents-UN-s.html) Ironically, such deaths are completely avoidable if we obey traffic rules. Our blatant flouting of road rules also leads to chaotic congestion on our roads in most of our cities and towns. Many amongst us have an utter disregard for traffic rules and do not care for others on the road. The Indian economy looses Rs [1.47 lakh crores annually due to poor traffic in our four largest metro cities.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/traffic-congestion-costs-four-major-indian-cities-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-a-year/articleshow/63918040.cms) To make matters worse, there has been a [spike in road rage incidents](https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/road-rage-on-the-rise-in-india-402893), with drivers on the road fighting like animals over petty arguments. Such a bad state of traffic does India no good.

It is unfair to place the blame solely on the state of infrastructure and the traffic police. India has the [second largest road network in the world](https://www.ibef.org/industry/roads-india.aspx), and this too is growing rapidly. Even in big metro cities, large-scale expansion of road systems is underway. Though [most Indian roads cannot compete with international standards](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/3.3%20India_Mr.%20Tony%20Mathew.pdf), there has been a tremendous improvement in the quality of road engineering and construction. Here, it is necessary to understand that even the world’s best roads will not be able to efficiently handle traffic if drivers do not obey traffic rules and follow [basic road ethics](https://sites.ndtv.com/roadsafety/road-rage-dangerous-driving-cause-maximum-road-accidents-india-1064/). Many of us also conveniently place the entire blame on our traffic police. While there is a massive scope for improvement in the work done by our traffic police, we cannot absolve ourselves from obeying traffic rules. No police can function without the support of the population, and this is also true for traffic.

## Introspection?

Our lack of respect for, and awareness of traffic rules is the primary reason for the bad state of our traffic. This is because a vast majority of Indian drivers are unaware of road rules and have obtained their Drivers’ Licences (DL) without undergoing any form of evaluation from the concerned authorities. After all, it is hard to respect traffic rules without first being aware of them. Even those of us who have legally obtained our DL have been corrupted by the state of traffic in the country. We often find it inconvenient to obey traffic rules, especially when we see others around us freely breaking them. Indian drivers now indulge in a melee when they drive their vehicles onto public roads and do not care either for traffic rules or the convenience of other drivers. This results in road accidents, traffic jams and road rage incidents.

We, as responsible Indians, have to start respecting and obeying traffic rules and spread awareness in our families, villages, communities and social circles. Many of our fellow citizens would benefit from this, especially ones who do not understand the concept of traffic rules. Some of them might even be able to prevent an accident from happening due to their understanding of traffic rules. We hold enormous power in our hands that must be wielded to make a difference in the traffic on India’s roads. We must also act as role models to our children who will grow up to be responsible drivers and spread awareness themselves. It is the Indians who have to usher in a change in India’s traffic. After all, if we don’t do it, then who will?

",AnIndianLikeYou," It is easier said than done. For example, today I stopped at a signal (before the line) because of red light.

This is actually the main reason I don't drive, it ain't worth it and Uber/Ola are cheap as hell.

Cat 4:- Past-the-wall Aunties. Too cumbersome to filter out + prefer foreigners, I don't blame them. Lack of matches I used Tinder on and off when I was in India, Bumble not so much. Went out on 3-4 dates and matched with decent number of women. This is over 2 years so no achievement.

I don't use them now. Reason being that I feel that most women over there are just killing time. And I can understand why. In a country like India where the dating scene is quite imbalanced women don't need apps to go out on dates. Especially when India isn't a safe country for women too. 

Not to mention if you're an average looking guy the odds aren't in your favour. So I have to make conversations with so many women which don't go anywhere and it just gets tiring. Most of the times it is obvious that the girls never had an intention of meeting.

Also I feel that dating apps usually attract lazy people. I am myself lazy and I don't have the energy to go out and socialize and try meeting women. So I try to swipe left and write sitting on my sofa in the hope of getting a date. I feel the same applies to women. The girls on Tinder, more often than not are too lazy, undecided or uninterested in taking any action. I had used Tinder in US for only 2-3 days while on a trip, got good matches. Not a single match in India in 2-3 years. I don't use it regularly though, one or two times in a couple of months.

And Indian Tinder is filled with fake profiles and who-knows-what-they-think pictures (at least in my location), I have to swipe left on like 10 profiles to come across 1 genuine profile, and still no match! Is it just me who read the first word wrongly ? -What made me stop ?


-Marriage I don't know. People aren't 'real' on there. Girls hide 75% of their face/body and when you meet them it's like ""Woah who tf are you?"". Most girls just want to feel better that someone prefers them. I haven’t stopped, I just use it less often these days cause work is mad hectic right now.

Bumble and hinge work well for me. Tinder is shit, it’s pretty much become pay to use/get seen ( at least for dudes)."

Visit SDM/Magistrate & ask them to take cognizance of this matter,once they’ve done that,you’ll be helped out.
Don’t worry,do either 1/2 ASAP Don’t visit local police stations,they’ve all been bought up by these goons,i will definitely trust the higher ups. Online complaints would be better mate if the police are not accepting your complaints

really sad that people are using rowdyism to take things that don't belong to them. Sad state of affairs in our country Are you ok ? Do you still need help ? Hi op, I'm a lawyer based in Hyderabad. I have a lot of advocates/friends in Bihar. Pm me  Tag more active and influential people on Twitter like dhruv rathee , karuna nundy and journalists. I would suggest to get your family  out of the locality and complain in some other city or police station. At the very least it will give you time to think about it and plan your move.  Hope your family is alright. This is making me quiet anxious.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",13,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,1555360902.0,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",FrustratedOCIHopeful," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",fenocs," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

AskIndia,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,54,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,1555627392.0,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",JaJH," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!"
AskIndia,What is 'Gotra'?,42,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,32,1543864935.0,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",ab370a1d," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.  
>  
>

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

Cheers.

AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,30,968di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,67,1533946806.0,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",PsychoPass1," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

AskIndia,We really need to talk about Flairs.,107,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair."
AskIndia,Who should I vote for in 2019 General Elections?,8,63l6vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63l6vm/who_should_i_vote_for_in_2019_general_elections/,50,1491423897.0,"Even though I was eligible to vote back in 2014, I was out-of-station during the elections and couldn't be back home in time to vote. I have never voted till now due to similar circumstances. 

Back when UPA I and II were in power, the obvious choice was BJP or its allies. But now that their true colours and agenda are out, my conscience wouldn't allow me to vote for them.

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state. 

I wish to see India as an educated, liberal and inclusive country that keeps religion out of its government.


**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*",concernedindianguy," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region. 

EDIT: Typo > BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.





NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself."

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time.",throw_for_bea," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc."

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love.

Not sure if it's the same as your thinking, but here's an article about how farm loan waivers don't help in the long run. Helping everyone is the best way to get votes. We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.

And we really need some new flairs.  > Rich people don't need subsidies.

It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  "

AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,43,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,1461362094.0,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

AskIndia,Buying an apartment in Hyderabad,3,8dg2ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,4,1524184933.0,"Hi everyone,
I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!",mdocvar," When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

I received this message. I want you to read and think about it. I am forwarding for that purpose""

",Bikihuigormint," BJP has learnt a lot from the humble onion, narratives on narratives and the core, nothing. > Nobody gave India confidence! 

Playing with people's insecurities. Not getting any women. Use this Axe deodorant and women will flock to you.

Did congress do nothing to give confidence to Indian people? When congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes. By recognizing their humanity, and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence. What about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? Was it not ahistoric in the region. And the states which were created on linguistic basis. 

> MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

It was exactly opposite. Gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims. 

> Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. 

When congress came to power, one of the first thing it did was to abolish zamindari system. Then it gave voice and entitlements to outcasts. 

> Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Dynamism of British period? Are sanghis missing their 'golden age' under white masters?

> people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered

People were not waiting for alms. People were poor and starving. Some folks have forgotten how poor India was and still it. Should congress have allowed them to die like China did? Is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? Can you not do both at the same time? Was it not something congress did?


> India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. 

NRI's guilt. 

 
 FFS all these chutiyas complaining about India's ""weakness and impotence"" are so clearly projecting their own shortcomings.

India managed to stay ""non-aligned"" under severe pressure from both US and USSR under Nehru. We were able to stave off handing over economy to the World Bank and IMF for as long as we could and when he opened up, we did it on our terms. We engaged in 4 wars and came out on top in at least 3.

We lifted more people out of poverty than any other country except China and corrected social injustices like untouchability which had existed for centuries.

And all of this while being a functional democracy, empowering civic institutions and fostering an inclusive multilingual, multicultural society.

How on earth - can someone say that is weak? If your family thinks this is any sort of accurate or well articulated I fear for their intelligence. Just a hypocritical NRI bhakt ranting about things he is  too lazy and selfish to change himself.  So many similarities between our new dumb entitled middle class and the hypocritical nationalist nris."
AskIndia,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,77,3de8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3de8cn/modpost_new_flairs_for_rindia_and_improving/,234,1437005483.0,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",r_india_mod," Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey I can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that. 

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.   


> Remove low-effort political self-posts.   

What is low-effort? [Lame] for worthless discussions going on here. 

And on a serious note, I think we need [Humor] or [Satire] or something on sort of similar lines. How about Reli[G]ious Start a [Gender issues] flair
India is boiling pot of gender issues with reservation for women to fake cases by women ."
AskIndia,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",30,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,1440193031.0,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs

* Politics: [P], [Politics]",r_india_mod," You guys are increasing your own work and in a couple of days you won't be able to do what you started and then selectively apply rules. Happens every time you still don't learn.  I'm confused.

> * **Link submissions** that refer non-personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a **self-post**

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form. So where exactly are you drawing the line?"

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!
",i_am_not_sam," what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. 
 > * Clarification on Flairs

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

> * New moderator
> * Repost removal

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Can (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.

> Score hiding

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

> About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   

What if it's a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   
 >Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bad

>but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama

Bad

>For instance /r/polandball[6] does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don't see what's wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!

Edit: I still see two flairs only. Not activated yet?

Edit 2: Ah I see.  > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.

> **Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal 
attack? Yes.** 

What the fuck? May I know when are you going to ban words like ""kulcha"" and ""kulcha warriors"" ???  Thanks for the change.  > New link flairs to be introduced -

No kulcha flair? Nice Work , When it will be done ? > We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

What will be the criteria to select this shortlist? Thanks for the link flairs! That was required. 

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well. 

 >New link flairs to be introduced -

Old article (older than 6 months)
Technology (phone reviews)
Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)
Finance
Twitter
Sports
AskIndia

Could we have a ""Uplifting News"" flair? I have been requesting for this for a while! Plis to include me on mod nomination plij.

I think this sub can use a right of center mod. :P

 >  Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

Can a person abuse himself/herself in the flair? My flair e.g. All I have to say is, please make sure the next mod is not a liberal. ALL of the mods are liberal as of now. Approved  Can we have some information about RTI in the /r/india wiki?


Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,50,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,33,1437709097.0,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

---

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

---

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon. 

---

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.",r_india_mod," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

Theme: Even r/Bharat a mature sub, has vibrant colors, our theme is dull, should have colors which looks interactive. > Governance - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts. However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.

Thank you for this :) Add a bakchodi flair for posts like [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3eiy7w/i_got_this_kind_of_spam_first_they_make_me_bhaiya/) Just wanted to complement you for the Ask India flair. It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a ""health"" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.
I want to filter them all out! Niyam kanoon toh thik hai, pehle is post ko sticky toh kar do. > Ask India - For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations

:D - Much needed! Can we get an '**International**' flair ? why misleading? why would i mark my own posts as misleading? Great!! Thanks for the speedy implementation! The flairs that you chose are great and will definitely help! However no call on the pol threads? >Regular - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers.

What is RDD stands for?? Random Digit Dialing!?? Can you guys change the colour for AskIndia flair? [deleted] short cuts for mobile users? > Ask India - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India[1] community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.

 I only have to say one thing .It seems from the eg /r/india mods put up like we Indians only care for sex and shit , there are tons of eg to put up. This doesn't look .. well good especially on a stickied post of most subscribed Indian sub.

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",11,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,1467222673.0,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",rajasthaniConfused," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years."

So, is there going to be any complications in the future after he joins this new org? He is worried because he has got one month salary and PF from the company he joined recently but has not disclosed the same while getting another offer. He has told them that he is not working currently and can join immediately!!

AskIndia,Bill Gates' thoughts on Climate change and India's Role in it.,82,3wcid0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3wcid0/bill_gates_thoughts_on_climate_change_and_indias/,10,1449848415.0,"He thinks that asking India to switch to cleaner and costlier energy is unfair. The developed world should take the initiative, dramatically increase investment in Energy R&D and come up with cheaper alternatives that are sustainable for developing economies like ours. 
Here's the excerpt from his interview with The Atlantic. 
>..when you turn to India and say, “Please cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that’s really expensive, subsidized energy,” that’s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

>I’m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they’ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China’s defined into that term.

> I want to call up India someday and say, “Here’s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it’s also better.”


[Full interview here](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/we-need-an-energy-miracle/407881/) It's worth a read. ",running_flash," You liked what he said? Twit to him and let him know about that. Bill Gates is an admirable brilliant character, unlike his late counterpart in another company. You know who... What if there is no renewable technology that is cheaper than coal? Should we say ""oh well, the free market didn't solve it, therefore let's all die in 60 years"". Carbon has a cost; we will end up paying it one way or another.

And obviously the west should do more. The biggest hurdle to combating Climate change from the West is the republicans that still in denial mode. And the powerful oil+gas lobbies. I wouldn't be surprised if their money funds cutting nuclear research, and many anti-nuclear activists.

It's kinda sad that he considers China a developed country that should be taking the lead on climate change and India a poor developing country, but that's reality I guess.

It's also important to remember that The Atlantic caters to a US liberal audience who are hugely upset by the climate denying crazies in the American right - India's problems are a distant concern. But to us in India the pollution levels are WORSE than China, so we should do more than be complacent. Throwing our arms in the air and going ""the west needs to fix it, not our problem"", is ultimately self-defeating.

But yes of course, the West needs to share renewable research and help out developing nations too."

Need some help / advice from you guys.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

Thanks for the help.

[Note: I am not sure how to add ""AskIndia"" tag. Mods please help]",microsoftholmes," if the amount is not very significant related to your salary , say about 25% of your salary, you can file an ITR showing it as income from other sources, but ideally, you should file ITR 4. "

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

I have only sent stuff out of the country once though . But the process involved just walking up to the Speed Post counter, and handing in  the parcels with to and from addresses listed. The chap behind the counter gives you a couple of forms to fill, one for the address, and the other for the customs declaration, and if you so wish, one for tracking the parcel or something....you then pay up, take your receipt and carry on on your merry way.

Sports,Pleasantly surprised with the amount of sports Hotstar is making available.,136,dvrc4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dvrc4w/pleasantly_surprised_with_the_amount_of_sports/,35,1573678405.0,"Hotstar is currently streaming U17 Women's Football Tigresses vs Panthers match. Why it's surprising that this match is being streamed:

* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

Pro Kabaddi has obviously had a lot of success too.

I don't follow other sports much, but a few badminton opens were also streamed AFAIK.",SreesanthTakesIt," Hotstar VIP is such a value of money. They always mess up the telecast via dish tv like how showing cricket in all star sports channels. Hotstar even telecasts esports. That's how deep they go. The quality is shit sometimes, but I can live with it. 

Now, if they could get AEW on their channel, literally everything I watch will be on Hotstar. I watched all of CWC and IPL on HotStar. My subscription money has been earned back easily Don’t forget the f1. Though the coverage is not comprehensive, like they don’t telecast fp1-2-3. But still a place to watch the qualifiers and race. The only issue I have with Hotstar is that their sports streaming quality is so bad! Low bitrate and an awful player ; I tend to find other streams even though I subscribe to Hotstar. Yes it's really good with the different kind of sports it's making available. Badminton coverage has been excellent.

Wonder how much the media rights for a U-17 women's football were acquired for (maybe free, it has only 4 teams). It's being organized by FSDL which is a Reliance subsidiary. For a newly launched event getting listed on streaming sites like hotstar and jio would be a boon. They stream F1. <3 Does it work with Chromecast? To the football fans, Hotstar is definitely a treat, up along with Jio TV which also shows some not so top level matches .

And even *Full Replays*…!! 

Its so amazing.

If I miss a match somehow due to timing etc, I can just see  the Replay 

Plus all the HBO shows!

It's definitely better than Prime or slightly better at the same price range

The only downside being its data consumption being too high, higher than Netflix and Prime Video. Where can I watch wrc races? I took the vip subscription just to watch ISL. Its definitely worth the money and also you can watch multiple sporting events. Hoping that the upcoming Olympics will also be streamed. Who here watches Women's football and what makes it interesting? I tried watching the world cup game; was boring so I'm interested in knowing if it's worth watching again. If yes, please suggest matches/teams/leagues. Now its even streaming endgame in hindi , and is all set to get most of the disney plus content , along with most having localisation in indian languages , netflix will have to DRIVE ahead fast , tailgating PrimeVideo to actually compete with them in india. Yeah hotstar has been a great boon for the neglected sports in India. 

Plus the fact that they have shows like Chernobyl make the deal even more worth it. I wish they stream chess. How to watch hotstar from outside India anyone know [deleted] I feel hotstar vip / premium at 1000 Rs for a month is very much value for Money."

The society can't see anything other than that Clearly that warning turned out to be false. India's heartthrob ♥️ also the reason why Indian men started taking special interest in tennis. This is one of examples of colonial hangovers. 
I still see examples of aunties saying, ""arre uska rang kitna saaf hai"". The moment you say that, you are unconscious implying that being dark is being dirty. Pathetic. I was never allowed to play outside after 1st grade for the same reason. I've ha a sad childhood. Kudos to her. Bro pakistan jaake shadi karni padi tujhe /s I don't like her. She is pretentious.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) says the girl who married cricketer from where again? :) aha the 75k make up kit wali... That's not exclusive to you Santa Ji. Tanning is not a problem but hyperpigmentation is and sun exposure leads to hyperpigmentation in some individuals like pigmentation around the eyes, freckles, mouth etc . Also sun is very harmful for our skin .So I would recommend do not go out in the sun especially girls because female skin is more prone to hyperpigmentation and sun damage . And it is very difficult to treat hyperpigmentation of indian and black skin tones. If your parents advised you to not go in the sun at an early age for whatever reason indirectly they did a favour to you . But if you still want uneven skin tone then that's your choice. And do you guys think sania mirza never went to a dermatologist for skin treatments ? I can tell by looking at quality of her skin that she did had treatments. And all of these treatments make your skin fairer then it was before treatment , although not fair then your natural complexion."

I was there as an intervention officer for all the three grand prix's. Best days of my life! It maybe a private project but most of it is funded by government banks 

Projects like these should have never been funded by government banks without any clear policy framework . It's a huge loss to the public exchequer , most of the lent funds will never be recovered . It was a beautiful track. But an expensive sport like F1 isn't designed for India. Even Azerbaijan and Mexico struggle despite drawing good crowds. Maybe a few years down the line. Although I don't see F1 surviving the end of conventional fuel era for that long. ""GP2 government... GP2 government. Aaargh!"" This track and other mega infrastructure projects like it are a testament to our quashed hopes and dreams as a nation. When I graduated from school in 2006, we all really did think that India would be a great and prosperous nation in 20 years.

And yet here we are! Idiotic waste of government money. None of the teams liked the track and perennially complained of pathetic conditions around the track. All this so a few rich folks could drive around their expensive imported cars. Bit of a waste of money IMO."

I don’t know why I am posting this.. Guess, I am just tired of getting rejected...

I’ve started feeling that I should quit and start doing something new. But the thing is... I’ve never thought of any other profession. Being a journalist made me happy, but lately I’ve started feeling that I am just not meant for it...

P.S. [edit] I did work for several brands, but during my last job tenure I ended term with some animosities with the employers. Also, it feels like I am venting here while typing the issue. Nonetheless, it’s a pickle.",Pscyked," You have everything you need right there with you, just look around, start writing the stories you always wanted to write, there is a whole wide world of social media options to choose from on how to broadcast what you write to everyone out there. If your stories resonate with your audience, definitely you will be able to better target your stories and start monetising your talent. All the best. Why are you unable to get a job? What's missing? Hey you could open your channel and let the viewers donate. Many people are doing this independent journalism. Like Faye D Souza who just opened her channel after being fired(or she just quit?). Look for these channels as well Kumar Shyam, Aam Press Tv. Get you own channel Try newslaundry I’m no expert, but maybe try writing your own articles, opinion pieces etc. and use free platforms like YouTube n such. Or offer them to local newspapers and magazines. Once you’ve got sufficient ‘by lines’ you could apply to bigger publications. There is a great dearth of good, well researched and independent journalists in India. Most of them now are pushing some agenda or ideology. Print journalism may still have some integrity but electronic media is a cesspool. Before even switching on the television, most of us can predict the spin each channel will put on a certain event. 

Journalists are much needed for this country. The battlefield of the 21nd Century is going to be information and attention with you people being the force multipliers of the arena. Though you are struggling now and have stumbled, don't falter.  Good luck OP! Find your niche and everything shall follow. Do not feel disappointed. Try getting in touch Newslaundry? Apna business khol do didi. Digital content marketing aur baaki sab. Write your own article and slowly build up your website. Best of luck. write a book. anything that's stopping you from doing that? as in the beat that you cover is not popular etc? I agree with most of the opinions here: if you aren't in bad place financially, start your own channel/blog, and publicise the hell out of it on FB/Reddit/IG whatever. It doesn't require a lot of initial investment (financially atleast), and you'd also be adding worthwhile experience to your portfolio, further making you an attractive candidate later down the line.

If you need any help setting up something, you only need ask! You have it in you already, you just need to go ahead and give it your best shot.

You can do it OP; we all believe in you! :-) Happens. Do introspection. Figure out what is missing. Work on small small things > Guess, I am just tired of getting rejected

No one has the authority or power to reject you. You allow others to do so. So, there is no point in getting tired or feel bad. Rather, I see such 'rejections' as a difference of opinion, thats it..

Journalism, in the age of digital, is one of the most exciting things to do. Keep expressing your views, via words, videos, images, and choose a platform to do so. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube are the current hot favourites, and if you are consistent, the right eyes will see you, the right ears will hear you. 

7 years of experience doesnt matter in this dynamic industry.. Your voice, your persistence, and your unique angle of viewing things does.

All the best! Have you tried Zee News? Maybe your writing sucks ? OP, the market is currently fucked.

The options that are available aren't really lucrative and the options you want aren't going to become abundantly available anytime soon. Brace yourself for a long 'winter'.

I'm gonna make a few assumptions about you in this response and I apologise if any of them are wrong.

Being a journo in these trying times is a difficult gig for several reasons. Traditional media has frozen/slowed hiring because they are not sure their existing ways and methods will survive. New media requires an additional skillset that not many traditional journos readily have. Companies are looking to hire hybrids - candidates who can seamlessly switch between traditional and new media. You might want to consider re-skilling or upskilling yourself with a certificate/course from somewhere reputed.

This is above and beyond the fact that some places are just shit to work at - you know the one's I'm talking about. Most middle management in media is either incompetent idiots or assholes on a power trip.

That leaves you with independent journalism, which is way more difficult that most people believe it is.  Any idiot can put up a YouTube video (and most idiots do) but good, proper journos will agonize over every little detail and end up not posting anything. Independent journalism is a difficult, uphill climb but the view from the top is worth it.

My recommendation would be hit up your contacts from your job days and pitch them specific stories/ideas/solutions pertinent to their brand. Design your pitch such that it plays to your strengths and their needs. You'll get probably one meeting every ten pitches and your first okay after ten meetings. Be prepared for that.

Alternatively, you might want to do a John Galt (not a great example) and work in something completely unrelated.  This will help you in two ways - one, it'll help you earn some money, and two, it will give you the option of getting away from it all for a short while.

Good luck, OP. I   would   like   to  suggest   that   you   think   long   and   hard   about   how   much   effort   you've   put   into   your   career   versus   how   much   more   it   has   to   offer.   The   reason   being   I   have   a   friend   who   is   trained   with   two   relevant   degrees   and   a   masters   in   their   field   also   who   seems   to   be   struggling   to   find   regular   sustainable   work.    

It   might   be   that   unless   something   ""dream   job""   worthy   came   along   you   will   need   to   work   part   time   in   your   field   and   supplement   it   another   way.

I   wish   you   good   luck."

The defendants try to not get touched or pull the attacker inside and not to let him go back until he leaves. The points on earned based on number of touches or number of pull backs. 

In a way it is like Football on a 20 yard strip with human instead of a ball. Lol you gotta check out rural olympics. maybe there are some youtube videos.

I mean howdo you high tarriffs on Tesla and other Electric Vehicles with the lofty claims made by ministers ? Do we even have the infrastructure to support electric cars? Yahan road hai nahi.... RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.

The core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don’t wanna import them. Make them here China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.

We need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets. 

Allowing Teslas here today at no import duty does not really make any sense. Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us Good. Hopefully, those import duties will stop one of the most exploitative corporation to exploit fellow Indian workers."

What should I do?

PS: I study in 10th. I have only studied in this school for a year and i can't take this anymore. Please help",R_asberry," beating students is a punishable crime, no teacher can beat a student. You have the right to report it to the police. Maybe someone else more knowledgeable can pitch in with the details. Long ago, when I studied in KV Firozpore Cantt, we also had a sports teacher, Mr Sharma who used to beat up the kids, especially the small ones from the primary section. One day, he beat up one such kid and broke his leg with a hockey stick. What he did not know was that the kid's elder brother was the local goon. Result: Sharmaji ended up in the hospital the next day with several broken ribs and fingers. After some months he returned to his job but never again touched a child. Post it on Twitter to @NCPCR_ - the national commission for protection of child rights. Don't even bother with videos or anything - just tell them that this is happening and it's not right. 

It's illegal to physically punish a child in India. He has no right to beat a defenseless little kid. 

Also please ask your parents to complain to the police or to the district magistrate. Il Write a letter to your principal signed by everyone in your class, if he/she already knows about it write it to CBSE or whichever board you have, also to education ministry telling in depth of incidents. Go to the police with an adult and report it immediately. Why are sports teacher always so sadistic? Why do they have a case of repressed anger? From someone elses quora answer: 

>  Beating or abusing a student is a punishable offence under
RTE Act, 2009 Section 17( 1) 17(2),
JJ Act, 2000,
IPC
Section 305,
Section 323,
Section 325,
Section 326,
Section 352,
And above that it is cruel and sadistic…..

As someone else said, first step would be to go to the principal/teacher.
Second step would be to go to the police.

You can also try using this feature: https://www.childlineindia.org/a/report/case , there is an option to keep your contact details confidential. Arrange for video shooting the act. Post it in Twitter, describing the situation, mention education and HRD misinsters in the tweet. Sports teachers are usually temporary. If parents come together and complain, they can remove him I am truly sorry this is happening. It boils my blood.

Get adults/parents involved as soon as possible. Convince them to reach out to the School and to the Police if it does not stop. Also, ask your classmates/fellow students to do it too, so at least someone would be sensible even if your parents are not being supportive. did you talk to your parents about this? They might help you by talking to the principle. Have you told your parents about this?

IF you haven't yet, do so now.

Speak to your peers as well and get them to speak to their parents about this, you all can write a petition and go to the principal of the school about it.

If the approach above does not seem like the way you'd want to go, then

Lol here in Gurgaon the teacher would have been beaten to shit the moment he stepped out of the school premises. If you are afraid of reprisals and dont have any other way out - 

1) Create a new throwaway account.  Not very difficult for someone to connect the throwaway to this query, but there are these kind of PT teachers all over the country.  Hopefully you are not the only internet savvy kid in your class......

2) Post your school and tormenter on the new post with the throwaway account .... and every one of us, can use our twitter/channels to highlight the issue.  We'll report it, write to the principal, local cops.  Nothing like shining some light.  They may not take it seriously from a random stranger or two, but hopefully some of the other kids will speak up when questioned.

Stay well, and dont let this get you down.  Better you do something to fix this, than look back when you are 30 years old and wish you would have done something. Think very carefully before you do anything, this is india, if the pt teacher is connected to the principal then the principal can make your life living hell, theres no such thing as an anonymous complaint in india, they can easily find your name Dude. Inform the CWC i.e Child Welfare Commission and ask them to get case filed under s. 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act. Twitter pe photo video daal. Tag news channels and child ministry. Sit back and enjoy Please notify other parents about this teacher so that PTA members can speak to the Principal about this asap. Alternatively, you can write a letter with regards to any recent incident involving said teacher, (mention that corporal punishments aren't allowed in school and if action isn't taken y'all are willing to go a legal route or call the media) and have it signed by students and parents in your class.

Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""
***
This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. 
I'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about ""unnaturality"" and the fact that ""it won't support procreation"".
Sir, we're already with a burden of overpopulation. If some people don't procreate (by virtue of nature), it's for better. More power to her. brave. respect to her God bless her, and may she get strength to win more medals for india Hope people to support her online, will do the same in real life too.

Radiolab did an excellant episode on her and the idea of how we differentiate gender and the issues it brings along. https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dutee More power to them, two badass ladies in love will only change the world for the better :) Upvote this post to support same-sex relationship in India. Make it reach top 👍👍👍 Thank You for giving courage to others like me So one upside of athletics not being popular in our country is she can live peacefully even after coming out. If it was some cricketer the whole uneducated jio troll brigade would have gone nuts! They can't even digest a guy posting a pic with her wife... [deleted] You go, girl! 👏 glad to see india is changing ... and for the better ... Man, I wish her the best in life. We should be proud of her for being brave enough to come forward. लोग क्या कहेंगे।।

लोग चादर्मोद है, कहने दो।।

What would people say,

People say assholes, let them blabber 😁 Great step to get public and help others also to accept. More power to her. More Power to her 🤗 It's good to know that she is proud to announce that publicly but I wonder how her career is gonna turn out in future. The environment and society around her will surely not be that supportive. WITH HER COUSIN!  Dude I can support being gay but I draw the line at incest. Yay! Yay! One of the finest Indian athletes has come out. This is really big. More power to her <3 What a Goddess. Really appreciate her doing this. Glad India is progressing. This is amazing! I love it. I just think it takes a lot of guts and support to do what she did i.e. acknowledging her relationship to public even after the Sec.377 some people still don't want to accept the fact that yes same-sex relationship do exist.. 
Thank God India is Changing Brave lady Glad to hear someone speaking up. Now, that's progress.  
Feeling proud! Wonderful! Good on her 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩✊ Respect her decision to confess this!  ***Keep Calm and Marry On !!!!*** You go girl!! There is a really good radiolab episode on her - https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dutee. She discusses about genders and her ban. Good for her. Hope she doesn't get harassed by the wonderful people in our country. Fantastic! What a great role model. It's hard to be out in India, but those that are able to do it do such an important service to all the struggling young LGBT kids. I'm so proud of her! 

Speaking of Indian lesbians, I recently watched Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. I'll be honest, I've always disliked Sonam and Anil Kapoor for their acting. But the movie, was really touching. 

It helped a lot that Sonam didn't wear much makeup and it was not glamour-themed like most movies are. It helped to focus on the plotline which I think was VERY cute. 


PS: if anyone has seen the movie, can you tell me what the name ""Kuhu"" Means? It's an adorable name. Thanks Is anyone even reading that a 18 year old woman went into a relationship with a 14 year old kid? If this was a straight relationship, the lot of you would be running around with pitchforks and candles by now. Yeah nice. We gotta reason to burn her images. Yay Indians get to work. I wonder why....ahahah I didn't read the full stop after soulmate and thought she was in love with herself. Godspeed! It's a similar situation all over the world. No pro footballer will accept that he's gay ( while he's playing ). I mean, it's brave of her and everything. And I'm totally for it. But isn't she in a relationship with her cousin's daughter? Okay serious question.

Dutee Chand has been found to have high testosterone because of hyperandrogenism. She was even banned once by IAAF all though got reversed later. Does her high T has to do anything with her sexual orientation? Isn't she the same ahtelte who was suspended or something for not being a woman? Good for population control. Go girl ! Nobody cares! Isn't homosexuality harmful when we see it purely based on evolution ?? [removed] [deleted]"

Sports,Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,22,ftltyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,5,1585860887.0,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",CuteFaithlessness6," > While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good.

It's too late dude. Many people in my community now believe that muslims are deliberately spreading covid19. Even my parents think that muslims have ""shown their true colors"". These 2000 idiots have increased hatred for rest of the muslim community."

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

&#x200B;",polashdeb," Thanks for doing this op. Also, can you also add ""non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided (sporting events, music events, etc.)"" Why is there a severe lack of testing centres in central and eastern parts of the country? That's where the real shitshow will be happening if you let this thing run wild. It needs to be at least 10 times more. Currently 63 centers, another 9 in under printing & packaging than IndiaPost!

And I've come to realize how Indian society mocks and pressurize teenagers to be at the top while completely ignoring the fact that not everyone has to be perfect and there is no shame in admitting that we are full of flaws and I'm hope people come up with things they want to say about themselves not being perfect 

Here I'll start

""I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports""

Edit : this post is not about me complaining or whining about my parents...neither is it about seeking redressal for being a failure in life(becauselets be honest we'veheard that crap a ton of times)...Its more about accepting the way you are because here in India every judge's you ..from you looks to your talents to your abilities....its okay not to be special because a large portion of people are above you...sometimes being bad at something everyone expects you to bd good at or something that everyone is good at and your not is Okay !!",spacejesus01," I’m 24 and unemployed I’m 30 and my self esteem is still tied to approval from others. 20s, and I have zero ambition and drive. I'm 8 years old, I didn't get into IIT My dad stopped comparing me with others after  I was raged asf and started comparing him, his salary, our assets etc with my friends fathers and his friends.

Since that day, I’ve never felt soo good. I am 23, and scared to drive Unconditional love is a scam. Your parents,girlfriend also have certain conditions when they will love you. You have to have certain job, looks ,satisfy their expectations when they will ""love"" you. I found that recently I'm 28. By our society's standards, I'd be considered an achiever. And I fucking fought really hard for it after an extremely abusive and poor childhood. But, I have anxiety issues. People don't understand it though. 25 and anxious to drive a car after a bad accident. 😁 I have ambition but no dedication, I am extremely lazy. ""I am 49 and your dad is dumb."" I'm 31 and no idea what to do and scared about the future all the time. I am 31, have very very big aims in life. But not even moving a finger to achieve it.. I'm 26 and still in college. I'm 25, my man! Haven't driven anything ever. Here's more:

* No friends nearby. I have friends but not one single friend whom I can call up anytime.
* I have no job, I am working on my software product. So living with parents for past 1 year.
* No money. (read above point.)
* Father probably hates and sees me as a failure.
* He also thinks I'm not man enough because of next two points...
* Short for a guy. (5'4 ish)
* Skinny af.
* Never kissed or even had anything resembling a girlfriend.
* Did I miss anything? 19 hates driving,but is pressurized into doing it. There's too much pressure to be special, i mean somewhere here only you'll find someone saying ""no but you're different, you're not like everyone else"" is it that bad to be an average person ? I think it's okay to be okay. Well to all the boys... the only thing I can say having lived in a PG in Mumbai, sharing the room with 5 strangers, and surviving on a diet ofvada-pav is this

> it’s okay to be dejected,

> It’s  okay to feel like a complete failure,

> It’s okay to not find love,

> It’s okay to have disappointed parents,

> It’s okay not to have money,

> It’s okay to do a stupid job,

> It’s okay that no one gets you,

> It’s okay.

> It’s okay.


> But,

> never stop learning,

> never give up,

> never ever.



> And

> Be strong,

> Be humble,

> Be kind. Fuck society that tries to measure you, especially that of your parents. You’re you no one can compare you , but they will do that at every step.. They think it’s their job and they will be persistent and passionate about it , so you better develop some serious belief in defying them and believing in yourself instead of sucking up to their judgment.

Tell yourself this : Growing up in this sick society means developing a thick enough skin where you don’t care a shit about such opinions, and I hope you grow into a person that’s defined by you and you take pride in what you’re striving for.

Your personality, your yardstick... everything else can go get fuck itself. Its this attitude of parents that leads to teen suicides. I am sorry not trying to be rude about your parents.. but stating the facts. Can we get F's in chat? 23 completed my undergrad and pursuing CA and CS. Cleared intermediate exams for both with good score but I’m not even interested in the commerce field. 

Absolutely no idea what to do with my life and currently, just going with the flow. wtf are you supposed to achieve at 19? I've just popped in from the exchange with /r/Ireland, I hope that's ok! I felt the same at 19, dropped out of college and all that jazz. I got lucky with a job, got qualified picked up some hobbies and now I'm putting myself back through college. Take it as it comes, if you're not progressing in one aspect of life pick something else to move on in. I can't professionally move up for another year or so, so I've entered into relevant courses, started diving and learning new things.

As time goes on you'll see the similarities in how you feel and how everyone else acts, everyone is doing the same thing. Just be trying. Most parents think that millennials are dumb and are taking our nation to shit due to their smartphone and pubg addiction. But in reality it's the politicians voted by everyone including older generation. Tell him it's his genetics , all the overachievers usually have intelligent parents .... This will really piss him off I'm 24. I can't drive. I haven't even bothered to learn to cycle. You have all your life. Screw that shit. 19 is not even that old. You've technically not even started adult life. I'm 28. Bought my first car this year. Can't drive. Hate all sports. The idea of going to the gym makes me wanna cry. I’m 30 and broke Same here.

""When we were your age, we already had you. When we were your age, we had built a house of our own. When we were your age, we had a stable job. When we were your age..."", when you were my age, the country wasn't going to the dogs. When you were my age, the country wasn't going to run out of water in the next 5 years. When you were my age, things weren't as politically fragile as they are today. When you were my age, the economy hadn't collapsed from top to bottom. When you were my age a huge, unemployed youth population wasn't out either protesting for more jobs or slitting each-other's throats for one. Your time was different. Accept it and move on. I am from pakistan and faced same issue. I am 29 now and after finishing bachelors(8 years ago) I had hard time getting job like everyone else. My father used to mock me each and everyday that you are a failure and you will never achieve shit in your life. He used to say so by comparing me with one neighbor guy who got a good job as a developer. I had skills and did job which I quit after 6 months because my boss was a dick. I had been full time freelancer soon after my studies and when I started earning more than that “developer neighbor” then all the mockery stopped all of a sudden and I became their most faithful and successful son. I am currently doing my dream job outside country and living in company’s provided apparent with family. I will never forget those mockeries and will never have respect for my father which I wish I could have I sought my father's approval for the first 24 years of my life. In the last 6 months, I've been depressed and suicidal due to feeling like there was no hope for happiness in my future. 

I realised any father who put his daughter in a position to choose between her own happiness and pleasing him, is not a good parent.

Stopped giving a fuck about his approval. Took a lot of time and therapy. But it worked. Against his desires, I moved out of the country to find a future for myself and I'm struggling financially. I struggle for food. But I'm happier than I've ever been in all my life. 

Seeking validation and approval lead to no where. There will always be someone brighter, better and wealthier than you that people will compare you to. They will never be proud of what you've achieved and they don't need to. You need to be happy with yourself. And honestly that has changed my life. I never thought I could be that person.

Edit: I'm 25 and know how to drive because I got my license but never drive a car because im not confident. 19M, with a drop year (in the first year itself). Under average in studies. Physically ugly. Virgin, never kissed or hugged. Had girlfriend for 1.5years and turns out it was one sided from my side. Can't drive car but I can ride Activa. Have a really supportive bestfriend but I don't treat her right. My behaviour goes toxic when anyone proves me wrong. I feel your pain. But if you're willing to learn, find a  quiet place and a friend to help(if you can) and wake up early, like 4 - 5 am early and learn it. It should hardly take 6-7 days. I'm 21, have a job but am lazy as fuck ,very poor with my finances & afraid that I'm gonna end up alone First time huh? I hear that rant everyday, its to the point where it doesn't even affect me, i practically live with existential crisis and top that with being an introvert, no one is perfect but our society doesn't understand a simple fact that not everyone can become the top 2% in a rat race that only favours the academically superior, but we apparently can't do anything do about it so just go with the flow, pretend it's the rainy season of your life, it'll pass and the sun will shine one day, just keep on trying I'm 16....got rejected by my crush day before yesterday....self esteem is pretty low...and seeing others like me on reddit makes me genuinely happy. it's interesting as a Canadian of Indian immigrants seeing the youth of India questioning aspects of Indian culture.  It's similar to what kids of expats went through when our parents first moved away.    
Not that the globe is smaller and ideas proliferate so quickly, Indian youth are going through the same cultural revolution that we dealt with.  Still one foot firmly planted in tradition while the other desperately dragging itself to a new reality  
I only offer the advise that stay true to yourselves.  There is merit in buying into the system, but don't be defined by it.  Play music, draw pictures and do the other things that are ""frowned"" upon cuz ""ye saab se paisa nahi aiga"".   
I also understand better the pressures previous generations felt, and so it's natural for them to push on to their kids.  Treat your parents with kindness, for they know not what they do .. they too are struggling with how the world has changed before them Bro start driving using a small automatic hatchback. It's so easy to drive and also have big red 'L' stickers on your car , you can remove it once you learn how to drive. Usually people understand when they see the 'L' sticker and will give you way and won't criticize you. Wake up at 5 am and learn to drive on empty roads first, once you get the hang of it go into usual traffic. I have seen people drive with L stickers for even upto 6-8 months. But make sure you learn to drive a car before you finish college it'll be absolutely necessary. Even experienced F1 drivers would be scared shitless when they drive for the first time in Indian traffic. I screwed up and failed my car driving test and that's saying something, as our country's driving test is an absolute joke and is perhaps, one of the easiest tests out there, in this world of ours.

This happened when I was around 19 years of age (almost 5 years back). I mean, I had hopes and aspirations that I would have obtained a license asap, the moment I turned 18. Well, it sucks I suppose, for life to not turn up the way one hopes too, even if they give their darnest best to make it happen.

I guess, my neuroticism and anxiety ruined that test for me, on that fateful day. Prior to reaching the testing grounds, my instructor made me do a trial on the roads, which I did a good job of and he assured me that I'll surely pass the test as long as I maintain my cool and composure.

But, he couldn't accompany me on the grounds and instead, another instructor who had no clue of my temperament and personality came. And he didn't help things for me. For every minor mistake I made, he kept belittling me, dismissing my anxiety and nervous attitude and told me as to how I seemed to be the weakest out there, when compared to other candidates who came along with me.

And thus, I was completely demoralised and failed the test. Everyone present on the ground, were laughing at me for my ineptitude in handling the vehicle. Did not speak with anyone, on that day. I'm 23, and I still haven't learnt to drive. Just saying:  


I was afraid to drive, and have never ridden a bicycle till this summer. I got a job and was about to move to Bangalore. I knew that I had to learn it, and if I stay afraid now, I'll hate myself for this in future.  


So in a span of 2 months, I learnt how to ride a bicycle, then a scooty and a car back to back. Sometimes the motivation comes from necessity. Let me see. 23 y/o, male. 

1. cant drive any motorized vehicle.
2. cant dance, cant party
3. cant be ""social"", some dumb-fuckery by someone always flips me off
4. In a quest to learn as much as possible. so that makes me a prick
5. Dont watch movies.
6. Dont like eating.
7. Dont particularly travelling In big groups. 
8. obsessive planner, not so much on the execution side.
9. One decent relationship that lasted 6 months.

&#x200B;

note: i can and do ride bicycles and I do trek solo (started this recently) My dad made me drive when I was 19 ( now 21 ) and I got involved in 3 minor accidents and naturally developed a fear of driving cars. I can drive two wheelers fine but they still mock for not being able to drive a car. Honestly this is more because of a breakdown in communication than anything

A lot of Indian parents are great at raising and talking to their kids till they're 12-13 but seem to completely lose it after that

Its important to note that you can't control or govern your kids lives as they get older and that they still need unconditional help and support from their parents

Kids are too afraid of their parents to say no when they get forced into following some field or career and parents are too focused on the future to see what's happening with their kids in the here and the now


That being said the kid themselves isn't blameless.. A lot of bright minded smart kids just lose the will to study/work/perform... And there is little their teachers or parents can do to understand if there is no communication.


As for you OP... If you have a clear idea of what you wanna do in life then let your parents know about it... Let them understand that you have a goal that you're working towards.. An aim that you want to achieve

They may be bullheaded about it but they still want the best for you.. Using my throwaway porn account because I don't want my irl friends to find out about his, ever.

20, Final year of BCA. Since I'm a failure (not engineer), My school friends consider me a failure and try really hard to hide that because that don't want to hurt me (Or maybe I'm insecure, Idk)    

* I still live with my parents, and I regret not living out on my own at least once every week.
* I know I'm not stupid (I'm always one of the first ones to build up logic for a program, I'm good at few things) but I have never achieved anything in my life, used to score \~50% in schools and hence have trouble with my self image in this aspect (If I'm smart who just sucks at studies or if I'm dumb and just pretending to be smart).
* Current college is shitty as fuck, I have grown to hate this city because I want to live away from it.     
* My dressing sense sucks, but I try to mask it with an ""I don't care what I wear"" attitude     
* I'm supposed to be preparing for MCA, which, if done from good college, Is the only way I can start earning. I have studied nothing in last 5 days, And my MCA entrance is 3 months away. I had told my Pune friends that I'll be visiting them around 18th of December, but now I'm having second thoughts because of not studying. I'm not prepared at all for this, I feel like I'm gonna be a fuckup. and the worst part of this is I'm not even trying to change things.
* I have a gaming problem, when I'm left with games, I stop prioritizing things, and play it till everything else is collapsed... Last time I spiraled out on my gaming thing, I ended up scoring really bad for my 12th exams (Hence didn't take engineering)  
* I'm really self critical, self conscious and a self loather (Not proud of it). There is something wrong with me, psychologically, But I don't know what. Parents won't understand what therapy is (Typical ""you're not crazy, try going out more"" mentality, I don't blame them for it). I have planned to get therapy with my own money once I start earning, Which won't be anytime soon.
* I know I won't do it. but I passively think that if I don't settle down by 25 (or atleast start to settle down), I will kill myself  (Again, I won't do it. I have felt suicidal twice in my life, and didn't even try to harm myself those two times.)

I don't even know why I'm posting this here, I guess I just need to vent. 19 , Didn't get into IIT even after taking drop, have zero friends and no accomplishments, Never had a GF , total waste of parents money Dude that pressure will always be there, irrespective of your age. Today it is abt your studies, tommorow it will be abt job, then about marriage and kids. 
I stood up to my dad only after engineering, i finally got the balls to say that i want to do business and not want to work in a MNC.
He listened to me for the first time after that full blown argument.
Now he encourages(read pressure) me to expand my business 😅 Turned 22 today, absolutely no direction in life. Have no idea what I really like doing. Most of us deal with this on a daily basis, correct me if I’m wrong. We could all use a hug right now. 
But only thing that keeps me going is no matter how hard or shitty a day gets, it doesn’t last more than 24 hours. I feel slightly better knowing that. Hopefully this changes the way you perceive things. Well I'm a teacher wage about 3000 RS per month 22 year old, lazy but hard working , have a dream of becoming an scientist or programmer but dream crushed by the same people The comparisons to other people of your age is normal and everyone has faced this in their life. Note that, I am saying everyone has faced this doesn't mean that it is right and in the contrary, it is detrimental on the mindset of how we are brought up. The fact is that after our parents do this comparison, some people don't give a damn after a certain age but some people still end up comapring themselves with their peers. 

Yep, nobody is perfect but we have to do something meaningful in the world to earn our living, etc. How do you want to earn your living and lead your life should be up to you and you alone, IMHO. If it comes down to something down something along the lines of '""Sharmaji Kya sochenge?""To kahiye sharmaji khud ke baare me soch lein, hum apna dekh lenge.' The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You really are not perfect are you comrade I'm 36 and can't afford a car. Forget driving anything. >I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

That's my description. Except I'm 22 Oh man that line 19 and can't ride a bicycle hit me. I am 20 i wasn't able to ride bicycle but few months back i made up my mind that i will learn after a week i was able to ride a little bit now i can ride a motorbike (not perfect ) . And also i have started focusing on my life i learned c , python and have started focusing on study . I would also like to mention i flunked in maths in 12 so i would like to say its never too late to change. 23, graduated last year, was working at a job I'd landed through campus placements.
But quit, because, big dreams, preparing for a very unpredictable exam with no back-ups whatsoever.  
No idea what's going to happen if my plan falls apart. Im 19 and I haven’t spoken to a girl in over 7 months I'm 27 and I'm alone. I'm 19 and I can't speak to someone(immediately) new especially if they are girls or someone of greater my age! I'm 20 and feel you. Financial freedom will get you out of misery. Try doing things that can get you some money here and there. Stock trading and shit. Once you start making enough on the side to help with some expenses at home meanwhile you do stuff for yourself nobody will say shit. I honestly feel like people need to know this one trick. It is a shame that you feel that way. Unfortunately Indian parents have a tendency to push their own fragile ego and aspirations on their kids. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you and don't let the things that your parents say get inside of your head. Get a job, become financially independent and move out. Just do not continue to engage in the toxicity of your parents otherwise things will only become worse for you. I am around 40. I moved to Europe decades ago for IT work, which I am still doing. A lot of my friends in India, some didn't even finish school, are now vastly better off that me financially. Two owns businesses and employs 50+ people. At least 6 have amassed so much wealth (land, properties) that they could retire any day they want. I have 20 years left on my mortgage here.

/I am not complaining though, I have a very good life. I'm 26 and I can't drive (but I'm gonna get back to practice soon). Graduated with an engineering degree at 22 from a national top 10 school, but working hard to re-enrol in a good college so I can finally study things I've always wanted to. Have a lean built but never made a serious effort to get a buff physique as I always found gyms expensive. Promised myself I will get over my discomfort and go to the gym every day when I get into college (and finally have time again). 20. Failed 2nd year of med school, taking a break for one year. Dad says he's ashamed of me and wouldn't talk to me. I've been sent to another city because he can't stand seeing my face, or hearing my voice. I can't talk to people my own age or people in general for that matter, even for small talk. I'm overweight. I'm 17 and supposed to crack JEE but don't know shit about solving those kind of problems, JEE starts on 8 Jan, fml 22 and can't drive because I hit my face on an iron fence while learning. Safe to say I'm perpetually petrified of vehicles and fences. 

Also intrusive thoughts. Does anyone else deal with thoughts that'd lead to brutal death while driving without anything even happening or is it just me lol I’m 31 and never been in a real romantic relationship. Wtf is wrong with me. The worst thing is the disappointment more than unemployment you see on the other fucking faces that we've let them down voluntarily & suddenly we become the bad guy 
Fuck this society I'm in my 3rd year of engineering. I feel like a complete shit. My parents are supportive of my decisions, but I give up things when the going gets tough for example Competitive coding and divert myself with porn or reddit.  

I do not have a routine. I lack consistency and discipline. But I want to get rid of this lethargic feeling that I get. Man... I'm loosing control over my actions. Any advise would be appreciated kind Randians. i choose Non medical but i dont wanna join IIT 20s, I fell from my scooter once, it wasn't a big fall neither was it very serious but couldn't bring myself to drive a two wheeler again. Learnt to drive my car, once i couldn't start my car on time after the green light and i don't need to explain the commotion i created at that time, which scared me a lot and im too scared to drive now. Also my left leg feels like it will fall off in pain due to me controlling the clutch in heavy bangalore traffic. So im a lazy and untalented according to my parents. Lol ok parents, im your child who has your genes

also using public transport is better for the Environment Exams after two days and I haven't completed anything properly. I am 18 and I have zero self confidence and even though I have been a performer before, now I am just really scared of going on stage and its funny because in my life  all I wanted was to be on a stage performing.

p.s. I am a trained dancer. 28 still studying .. This website is weird AF.

\> I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

Sports? Never knew Indian parents gave two shits about sports. Play anything, you will get flying HC Verma on your face [deleted] Indians parents are one of the worst in the world. I am 1.6lpm guy but my failure  count is much more than  success count . Sure, society does put pressure but don't use the anti-thesis to just be lazy. Dream, work for them, else life is just pointless void without real higher purpose anyway. Bro. Just find out what you really like and work towards it. It might be against their will but that's how you can give an answer to them and to the society. 20 and still confused if I want to become a software engineer or a musician. I mean I love both but I'm not very good in either of them. :( Rather than think about what you are not good at, think about what you like and are good at or can be good at.
You don’t judge a horse by how fast it swims and a fish by how fast it runs.

If you are not good at studies, maybe you like cooking, or art, or sports, or gardening etc.

Find your passion...
Don’t let a negative opinion define you. This is all a direct result of Capitalism tbh. I'm n years old, and I can't do a lot of things - but unlike the losers who don't want to put in the effort to be able to do those things, I genuinely want to improve, and am working toward being what I expect myself to be, instead of whining about it on the internet. In the mid-20s. Unemployed for over a year. No social life anymore. Skinny, tall and bald. Very anxious about everything. I'm good at driving, just anxious. Failed driving test. 23 and hate myself to the core. I had social anxiety so talking to others really makes me nervous. I am so perfectly imperfect. I'm in my late twenties and I'm rediscovering life after nearly a decade of depression.

I'm still depressed, of course, but I don't have to let that define me, or dictate who I am or my actions. I've been depressed so long that my childhood memories seem like they happened to someone else. Like I was an observer to my own childhood.

But eventually the clouds will clear, even if it seems impossible. We will never be perfect, but we will bear our crosses and carry on. Because that's life. Suffering, peppered with moments of joy, pain, heartbreak, melancholy, and loneliness.

You'll be alright. We all will be. Its perfectly fine to be self-aware and being comfortable with yourself. But more importantly its necessary to try and fail rather than just being a silent observer and judging other's opinions. If you have anything that keeps you awake at night, you must pursue that coz it's the effort that counts more than success usually. I dont like any sports thats just okay. But ARE YOU AN ENGINEER ? Abey fuck same Logged in to tell you this. I learnt to cycle at age 28 and now I often bike 30 kms to work. Hang in there dude, you'll get there.! The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You weren't joking when you said you weren't perfect comrade I am 21, I'm scared to learn to drive a car. I also sometimes feel like I've wasted myself academically to the point that there's no climbing back up for me. I also put off seeing a psychologist cause I feel anxious to even go lol I moved to Canada when I was 22 and long story short, I fucked some things up and came back to India 2 years later. Now I'm 25, battling depression, still unemployed but trying my best, listening to parents' whining almost every Sunday.

So, you're good! I am 23, and not able to drive a bike, recently learnt to ride scooty on street. I am graduated and got a decent job with decent pay. Yet, so doubts that not able to interact and have a deep conversation with anyone easily. Lonely af. Still life is beautiful. I have been a "" Sharma ji ka beta"" Kinda guy in whole life. So can't even complain. :). I like how OP is talking about accepting ones faults while the comments are filled with suggestions on how to fix that fault. 

Thanks for proving his point? I'm 30, fat(29 BMI) and haven't gotten promoted in a looooong time! I am 21 and i cant talk to girls. Yea the irony being ( in relation to the post) I know what iam doing but it ain’t progressing. 

Fingers crossed As someone who's disabled and struggles with mental health, I've had a lot of other things happen in my life that has made me feel in similar ways. 

&#x200B;

I have developed a very anticapitalist mindset as a result. Fucking wholesome this thread. I'm 26, graduated in hotel management, decided not to pursue the career, did MBA in marketing didn't wanted to do field work, did digital marketing course, didn't liked it, so here i am, working in a KPO as a fresher, on minimum wages, clueless of what I am going to do next.... Oh and did I tell u that I am socially awkward and a virgin who never had a girlfriend, yeah that and I sometimes hope for an alien invasion so that my society's focus diverts from me! I'm 19 (M)

First year at IIT. 

Severe body dysmorphia that I tell no one about. 

An ldr that I'm desperately invested in. 

No friends in college. 

Read incel websites and find myself agreeing with bits and pieces of it. Feel terrible immediately afterwards. We all Drew a tangent to the op conversation. I have heard countless stories of your loved ones comparing you to someone else. I feel so hopeless for such loved ones of mine they have spent all of their life comparing crying and living to fit in the society. “You have to this to make good name” “what will society think” “will you go marry a girl pf different caste and make us look like we raised a fool” The core message is *stop living for people and society start living for yourself*. I hope to get this in my grand pa’s head someday! You just copied my situation, although I'm 18, not 19. Guess some things about boomers never change. You are not trying to achieve and like to stay remain where you are so, not taking any chance to do new thing. Thats great. People should accept you. You are normal. Don't listen other. Do what you want. I dropped out for 3 years and did nothing with that time Seeing all the people who are scared to drive I think you could also blame Indian roads and driving practices. I too hate driving because I have a terrible attention span. But it's doable as long as you take enough caution. I am trying to loose weight since 2006, I am 26 😢 The other day I saw fuckin rickshaws drive on the footpath , ofc now I'm scared to drive I'm 19 and I'm in college and I just feel numb most of the time and I'm lacking self esteem and have zero ambition in life. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this but I'm going to fucking get out of this shitty state. That’s just bad parenting - showing that your parents aren’t perfect either :) I'm 18, and feel isolated in most social situations. The few people I am close with to the point where this isn't a factor are toxic and make me a worse version of myself. I want to make better, more meaningful relationships but my low self-confidence and insufficient social aptitude make it difficult.

&#x200B;

:') I am 22, overweight, and procrastinate alot I am 17 and very socially awkward. I have trouble talking with strangers and making new friends. I am 18 and just want to die. I'm 19 and I forget to take towel with me to the shower . Hi maybe i can advise u on what u can do. Can i ? I'm 20, I've given NEET 2 times and I haven't got in. *""The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.""* --Mahatma Gandhi Okay guys, I will start practicing driving yet again this week.. I've been neglecting this due to the anxiety of driving a car after I near drove my car into a marsh People who complain about a generation forget who raised them. Expectation is a two way street. I'm 19 and I've lost interest in life. Don't give a fuck about anything, not even my parents. I haven't cried properly in 4 years thanks to extreme bullying and shaming in high school. Don't get me wrong , I love life. Suicide is the last thing i will ever think about. But , I just want to have more confidence  in myself. I'm completely emotionless, have 0 interest in life in any aspect. I don't play any game more than 3 minutes, don't read a book or a topic more than 2 lines and give up on a task even before I start.  I just want to feel an emotion. that'd be good. Hello there. Well hate to break it to you, but you are not even at the worst stage of your life. Soon in a few years you'll be pressured to get married. And yes arranged. And if you still don't have a job? Be ready to face the wrath of your parents. Yeah Indian society. I mean of course they mean well but this isn't the way. Man sometimes i think what if I become scientist or programmer should I'd be happy I am 21, too chickenshit to drive or ride a bike, thinking about dropping out of post grad I am 23 and I was super scared to drive in India. While my friends had their licenses and driving their cars, I used sit in the back seat. It's only when I moved abroad I learnt how to drive. Oh and I also dont know how to ride a bicycle, bike or even swim."" I'm 19 too and I can't think anything else other than just killing myself. I'm 29 and I've not saved my first million ₹ yet. 22. IIT graduate. Didn't learn a thing about Engineering. No idea what to do with my life. I can relate, buddy. 
Indian parents expect their children to be like satya nadela or Bill gates. 
When we tell them that we can't, they come up with bullshit stuff like - 'look at that guy, he had nothing and now he is -insert a high level title-' 
Or  ' We sacrificed so much for you, at least do this or that' I am 23 (M). Here are some of my flaws/failures:

1. I didn't complete a B.Tech. from IIT or a B.Sc. from St. Stephen's. I could never sort out my priorities as a teenager so I ended up attending a ""decent-ish"" DU college instead. 

2. I do not work for McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Amazon, or Google. My family believes that I am competent enough to reach great heights, and I try my best to make them proud, but so far my path has only been full of disappointment.

3. My girlfriend, whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, grew uncertain about the future of our relationship so I ended things on a bitter note. In hindsight, maybe I couldn't handle all the stress and acted rather impulsively. I still think about how I could've done better in that situation.

4. I've got no real friends whom I can depend upon to always have my back. There are plenty of friends, but no one who will sit with me and genuinely inquire about my problems. I guess I might've taken the nicest people that came into my life for granted, and now it's impossible to completely fix that even through honest apologies.


It sucks to have to deal with all this, but I've somehow learnt to find happiness in the small things. More importantly, I choose to focus on becoming a better version of myself everyday and not get too affected by my past. Maybe, there is a bigger plan that's laid out for me and I just can't see it yet? Who knows... 25 M, cant drive, extremely overweight(borderline obese), no zero ambition or drive for anything in life. Constant complainer and down in the dumps dummy Hey dude I feel like I've done nothing many times - especially when I perform lower than what others expect (which is your case I believe).

If thinking that ""Indian society is shit and makes you feel shittier"" makes you feel better, be it. Sometimes having a certain opinion about something can make us fell better. 

However, you can't hate on your parents, or as a matter of fact, any blood relation always. I try to convince myself by thinking that most Indian parents care more than parents in other cultures do. It has its advantages and disadvantages. I'm sure we do get a lot more moral support sometimes (not all) than others. But sometimes over expectations leads to such situations.

Edit: corrected spelling [deleted] My friend is 30 years old at this moment.
He has never driven a motorcycle in his entire life so far.

Wholesome comments, wish to see this kind of conversation. I’m 25 and unemployed. My younger sibling is employed. I’m just a waste. . ! I am 22 and single for 2 years"

Sports,How should I feel?,10,fn5zmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fn5zmp/how_should_i_feel/,6,1584935723.0,"How should I feel that I'm privileged? I'm 25, earning 60k, and it's not that I'm dumb or something but sometimes I feel how to feel. My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age. 

Thanks for reading.",HumanWhoLikesDogs," You seem like a balanced person, someone I would enjoy having a drink with. 

I think the answer to your question is clear - do as much as you can to bring privilege, education and opportunity to those that don't have those things. 

Or perhaps make as much money as possible, and live your life doing the things you enjoy. I'm guessing your thought process would naturally lead you to the former option in any event. When do you plan to marry and get settled?"
Sports,Why are there no indian cheerleaders??,22,es9hc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es9hc2/why_are_there_no_indian_cheerleaders/,32,1579712955.0,"This is a serious question. Ive typed indian cheerleaders on youtube, google, google images, etc and literally all of the results are of european girls. 

In IPL, ALL of them are european girls. 

Culture cant be the only reason. I mean in such a huge population, there should be some that are open enough to perform routines. 

Is it regarding attractiveness? Theres no shortage of bombshells in india, especially given the population. I would really love our beautiful brown women to take up this sport. Its a well respected sport in many developed countries.

I seriously dont get it lol. Why bring girls all the way from europe and north america?

Same thing with bollywood and the background dancers but there are some indian dancers still in there.",Dungeonmaster0396," Cheerleading is not a recognised sporting activity India. In fact, it's not very popular outside of the States. While growing in popularity in some western countries, competitive cheerleading is not attached to a lot of sporting events. So, not a lot of what would be called actual cheerleaders would not be found in India. And for IPL, the so called cheerleading was nothing but a commercial eye candy spectacle. Want more people showing up to fill stands, give Indian men white women in skirts to look at. CSK used to have Indian cheerleaders. They even had a guy cheerleader. If I remember correctly there was also something about the colour of our skin. We discriminate a lot (which is also why we don’t see any Latina/Arab or black cheerleaders) Amit Malviya, Tejinder Bugga, Payal Rohatgi would be amazing as cheerleaders They're either gonna get raped, groped, cat called, slut-shamed or all together.

Our society is happier oppressing people, human rights & basic human decency and all, are unimportant.

Also,

""Log kya kahenge""
""Aise kapde pehene to mard kya karega?"" I think its the same reason why we don't have strip clubs. Our society looks down on it because its not pure or its against godliness all that stuff. Must be something about indian mentality. Cheerleading is probably down there with lap dancing and mujhra dancing. People think it's a low job that doesn't deserve any respect. Until this changes then you probably wont see indian cheerleaders on google youtube etc. Its really sad as there is nothing wrong with this type of work. CSK, KKR and the defunct PWI have Indian cheerlearders donning traditional clothes. Google Images should give you some pics! I guess when IPL started, Lalit Modi and the powers at that time decided to import the cheerleaders to get more eyeballs in, and that trend has continued. This is what keeps you up at night?"

Sports,Why isn’t scholastic wrestling not a part of extra curriculum in Indian Schools despite wrestling being a popular sport in Indian culture?,18,dnq7jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dnq7jf/why_isnt_scholastic_wrestling_not_a_part_of_extra/,5,1572190064.0,"Wrestling or kushti in hindi seems to be one of the most popular indian sports and martial art of India. The history of Akharas makes it look like India really is into wrestling. So much that often time whenever a normal indian fights you can see him using a crude style of wrestling.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

And most parents are so overprotective that they wouldn’t allow their ward to train in fear of him being hurt or injured?",The_New_Renegade," Because kushti is very limited to parts of North India, and it's not very common anywhere else.  Sure, if it's popular in a locality, they should promote it there but I don't see kids in Mizoram being as excited about it as Punjab. I can think of two reasons:

1) In india entrance tests are pretty much the key to higher education and career prospects, so there is no point in spending time on sports
2) Not all colleges give admission based on sports quota, unlike western colleges where a number of athletes go to to colleges based on sports scholarship Infrastructure and lack of coaches. Otherwise it is just shortsightedness of the education-focused country. Because many prefer taikwondo or karate."
Sports,60 thousand fans turned up today to support the Indian football team against Bangladesh.,3447,dib0ns,https://i.redd.it/pkvfka0smqs31.jpg,119,1571188457.0,,Poirot17," we should have won against bangladesh .. draw is a tad disappointing. YBK is a great venue to play for the country Isn't this at Salt Lake Stadium? Indians started loving cricket after 83 win... Maybe if the current team could win something big people would go crazy... I truly believe in the next 4-5 years India is going to be a competent side I like the banner with Mohammedan Sporting, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Let's not forget the originals! I was on my way to a late meeting before the match, and EM Bypass that connects the stadium was jam packed with cars and bikes, with Indian flags all over, Flying high. Some of them wore cricket jerseys as well lol but the passion in my city for football is crazy and as a fan I love it. Imagine playing in a world class stadium with jam packed audience chanting football slogans and appreciating every forward pass you make, It feels like home. I love the fact that so many people turned up for the game. Sad that we didn't win but absolutely love the support that was shown to the team. Hey I can see myself!! My small rant about the situation of football in our country: 

You need development from basic stage, And one of the biggest drawbacks for India is the weather then you have diet issues and no proper scouting and organizational structure. I can share a small story that might interest some of you  

I come from a small town surrounded by many Adivashi colonies, During my schooling I was an active football player and I even played inter divisional football for the South Eastern Railways, That time I used to see some Adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( Credit to their hard work and natural diet ), Some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, We still had a hard time beating them, Heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows Over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , I leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. 

We still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.

I still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.

Edit: retarded typos. A sight to see.. I’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies. Football is slowly picking up pace in India. With so many young kids attracted to club football in Europe and better focus on training facilities, India will slowly improve its standing. But it's still a long way to go, maybe 10-15 years before we get to the top 50 rankings. ...and got disappointed. A win would've been the true appreciation for the people present.. Nevertheless, good show! Loved the giant poster consisting portrait of 3 players wearing East Bengal FC, Mohonbagan FC, Mohammedan SC jerseys standing in a huddle.. ,😍 This is proud for any nation, for this kind of fan following. Yuba bharati kirangan 🧡 U/manjit2990 did u watch it or to maybe support the BD team against India? ^(/s) The mecca of Indian Football.. people in Calcutta share an equal passion for Football and Cricket. just wish t'was the same in the whole country I'm from Bangalore and support BFC. In the initial seasons, the much talked about West Block Blues held up a banner,that is still held up at major games today. That message is all inclusive and is ever more important now.

""The road is long, but the belief is everything. Stand up for Indian football.""

Never been so proud to see a packed stadium for our games. Unpopular opinion: Team performs better without Chettri.  [SC: We couldn't deliver a performance to match the atmosphere at the Salt Lake last night, and the dressing room is very disappointed about it. We couldn’t capitalise on the chances we got,but this is a process on the pitch and in the stands. You turned up, we'll keep attempting to.](https://twitter.com/chetrisunil11/status/1184295678626779137) Do the people on seats under the big flag get to see the match? Or are those seats empty? 60, 000 there, yet still no comments here. +1 Koi video dikhao bc Amazing Spectacle Keep it up Good news! Love it :) Cuz there are too many of us to go around Soo much support. Yet internationally so behind. 

My take: Sporting culture is minimal. No places to casually play. Courts, grounds, spaces are accessible for the  rich only.  Developed parks have the infuriating ""Park mein football aur ball sports khelna mana hai"" (football and ball sports not allowed).  I have seen people stopped for playing catch with a tennis ball. ""band karo ye!"" ""park ka satyanaash kar diya hai!"" (stop this. Have spoiled the park)

Development, training, diet are obviously important. But loads of countries ahead of india in football have these problems. There definitely seems support for Soccer in India. How has it not translated to something like cricket. This is kolkata we are talking about the turnout is expected. I think crickets popularity will be over within 2 decades because the game is too long as well as boring because it is almost entirely dominated by our country now. And sports like football will rise in popularity but i am not sure if sports will ever be as popular as west in our country because we never had a sports culture in the first place and it is introduced at a time when video games are rising in popularity , and second thing is most of these outdoor sports originated in the west where temperature is cold but in the scorching heat of india i dont know how comfortable it is to play these sports thats why i believe sports like kabaddi are better suited for indian environment and might become popular once again someday or some new indoor sport might be created . JAI HIND Glad that football is picking up in India, but I feel like instead of organising matches in cricket stadiums building more quality football only stadiums and keeping matches there will really be a huge boost to the game here. More fan come to see Kerala blasters play Stop hyping this dumpster team. Indian football is corrupt and will take a 1000 years to even qualify for the world cup. They can't even defeat Bangladesh.. pathetic Virat ne kaisa perform kia? :) Feels like a slutty click bait title. 60k people went to see an interesting match. Not necessarily to “support” India [removed] Can someone explain how Qatar couldn't beat us in their own backyard? Was it the under 14 women team or something that were playing against us that day?

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It's really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley's for Adults What's the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced ""di-ka-thlo"" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It's my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. 

I have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I'm sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country's young guns. 

Their staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. 

If anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don't need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I'm hearing about this brand for the first time 😅 Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this ""Decathlon is Hamleys for adults"" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms? Mostly i have seen people who are into sport there 5:10-6 ft easily, i wonder how they manage in their. I am 5:9 and i find it really difficult to especially for bottom wears. I love Decathlon.
I also only buy running/cross-training shoes (or such critical gear) only from nike(or high quality brands).
It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.
Foot calluses or even alignment and stride, or injuries are difficult to avoid if you're hitting the pavement or the treadmill for 10km 3 times a week. If you can reduce probability by even 10%, the high price is worth it. After they opened in Chennai I stopped bothering with the other brands, much more affordable imo.

It is x times cheaper to nike Adidas here as well Wait, when did Decathlon open stores in India? Call me sastaa or cheap but I always prefer DMart to these costly brands (both foreign & Indian)."

Sports,Hotstar video quality is total crap,153,e006q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e006q5/hotstar_video_quality_is_total_crap/,73,1574453741.0,"I've got a 100mbps connection which plays Netflix, Prime YouTube at full hd or even 4k (YouTube only) absolutely fine. But Hotstar is a completely different animal. 

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

App: Hotstar Android
Phone: Samsung Note 9

I don't know. It kind of looks as if Hotstar is trying to save bandwidth costs. Out of all the major streaming apps, Hotstar is the only one without hdr, and it's video bandwidth is already pretty less (pixelations). But now it seems that they have decided to remind the customers - you get what you pay for. Only if Disney wasn't pumping all the latest shows there, I'd have switched away long time ago.",skynil," Imagine having to watch F1 on that. Low bitrate

This is why people pirate

They need to upgrade their hardware No, it's not just you. Hotstar's steaming quality is absolute shit. Makes me really appreciate Netflix. Those guys are miles ahead of everyone else when it comes to their streaming tech. Hotstar has shit content if u ignore HOOQ HBO. 

You can directly but HOOQ subscription btw I feel this. Cunts have the worst streaming platform. YT/Netflix streams 1080p smoothly but hotstar still buffers at 480p. As someone who follows EPL, I really wish there was an alternate option to Hotstar! Why is nobody talking about the forced cropping to 16:9 on every Hollywood movie? This shit sucks. Pay for hotstar and pirate HD if you feel bad about pirating. You've done your part, and avoided the shitty quality and logo that exists for fuck-what reason. 

And the content discovery is so shit. I have to check just watch.in to see what available. The top movies on my screen has The Hunt for Osama bin laden for the last 6 months. Is this a top movie? Who the fuck is watching this? It's a cheap documentary for fuck's sake. I have no problems streaming Hotstar on my Android TV, but on other devices like my phone and laptop, it absolutely sucks. And then broadcasters complain about piracy It works well on tv but yeah on android its the worst ,same thing for amazon prime Quality is good on computer but on Android it sucks...I sent them an email regarding this but no one replied. Even on HD setting, quality is worse (I was watching live cricket match at that time and it was 3-4 months back). And I thought they are providing low quality to the viewers without subscription so I took the sports pack but quality was still poor. Their iPad UI is equally shit. No PiP mode. Can't see the time/date while playing video. But their Mahabarath does not have Subs 😤 🙁 😭 It’s very apparent in darker scenes and you can literally see the pixelation in the areas with shadows. Also they somehow manage to fuck up the color and white balance. I mean the blacks appear dark grayish for some reason. 

Unfortunately it’s the only source for many classic HBO shows so I kind of live with it. Mate it's what you get for what you pay! Welcome to India....Oh wait, you're Indian...you know the drill! Their web UI isn't that good either. Do you guys get irritated by how, when autoplaying the next episode, the video player would exit from full screen mode. Sucks in android but decent on PC.
I got is only for occasionally watching live sports, and even then sometimes it's service is down for live sports like PL, tennis.
Content wise Netflix is the king(atleast for English content) [deleted] I use Hotstar everyday. My video quality always remains on high and I get really good quality. This is on the desktop site though, I never use the app. I feel like Hotstar's quality varies with shows and streams. Whenever I am watching a game or watching an English TV show the quality varies from trash to garbage. But whenever my mom starts watching her Indian TV shows, it plays at the highest possible quality without any hiccup. Hotstar is crap!

FTFY I doubt thats even 480p. Probably 360p at max. It also has the worst compression I have ever seen on an OTT platform. The blacks get absolutely crushed and the audio (specifically dialogues) often get distorted.

(I watch on macbook, android phone, and windows pc with studio monitors, and they all have the same problems) I have a 40 Mbps connection and hotstar works well, usually in full hd on my fire tv and pc i dont use it on android. sometimes it buffers when net usage is high but quality never goes below 720p Pay and pirate"

Akshay Kumar : Ab rapid fire round. Tell me what comes to your mind first when you listen to this word. 'Phone'

Modi : Selfie

Akshay Kumar : Flower 

Modi : Lotus

Akshay Kumar : Bird

Modi : Rafale, wo bhi udtha hai na

Akshay Kumar : Family

Modi : Amit Shah

Akshay Kumar : Drink

Modi : Chai

Akshay Kumar : Janta

Modi : Chu..Chalak Akshay kumar and twinkle Khanna are such hypocrites. They maintain totally opposite personas. And both for gain. Real persona is 💰 💰💰💰💰 Akshay is asking Modi to replace him in the next movie involving 'Khiladi' in the title. Likh lo: Yeh chodu baadme ticket bhi maangega. *Sunny Deol roars in the background*

I had immense respect for Akshay Kumar once upon a time. Lately, everything he says has a desh Ka/ki prefix to it. Desh ki mitti, desh ki movie, desh ki Tatti, desh Ka lasun. When exactly did he become a sellout? _Isko koi Karan Thapar ke saath bithao yaar._

_Ravish Kumar bhi chalega_. Everything modi does is political in nature, even meeting his own mother. I don't think this is any different. Chilla chilla ke sabko amero ki scheme batade Someone must have told Modi he needs to show his softer side. Become more likeable. Nice try! Canada Kumar at it again! https://youtu.be/ctrgPD9s_yY?t=13 I don't think we elected a PM. We elected a superstar who tries to fit into the hero persona. Modi *kaka*: Time to pay for the National Award bro. So basically full 1 hr of ""aap thakte kyu nahi""

Non-Political,[Non-political] A/c train queue system implemented by people on their own,1599,8gwqi3,https://imgur.com/x2S75mL,207,1525438541.0,,imacrazydude," Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*
Am I on the right sub reddit ? 
*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

Finally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station? And then there's that one mandatory asshole who decides to jump the queue and plunges everyone into the usual state of chaos. This is how anarcho syndaclisim works people  [deleted] Mumbai Meri jaan unreal
 Is this a Photoshoped image ? I honestly find it had to believe but if true. Wow the wonders!  This is so nice.
 That's very Non-Characteristically Indian Same thing I saw in Mumbai a few days ago. Glad finally people are adopting this. /u/DNA007 :) Wow! Welcome to New India.  Cleverest people , if all mumbai and suburban trains do this , half the problems will be solved . nice post Kaun hai yeh log, kahan se aatey hain ye log? This is common in mumbai at bus stops. In fact no where in India do people 'follow traffic rules' as much as mumbai in my experience.  What alternate universe is this? Sandwich massage for free I can confirm that this happens in the gold class of dubai metro whereas as in normal compartments people just rush in and out like in india They do this in nyc too........  Security staff in Bengaluru metro makes people queue up like this. All of that vanishes once the train arrives lmao Yeh kabse hone laga yaha??? 😯😯  Nice editzz Queing for reserved ticket isn't a big deal. But for local it is. It is impossible . looks like they renovated borivali When people start building a whole railway station on their own without any corporation help, I'm not amused when they start standing in queues.

Arnab Goswami,BJP: Runs a news channel Repulic TV in partnership with BJP MP. TV Debate on the channel target other parties excessively",fakeforconfession," Anupam Kher  - wife supporter like every man should be. ;-) Vishal Dadlani AAP Radhika Roy founder of NDTV is sister of Brinda Karat, MP from CPI(M).

Subash Chandra founder of Essel group which includes Zee News, is a MP from Haryana with support from BJP in Rajya sabha. I respect people like Kher more than Amitabh Bachchan, at least we know where their loyalty lies.

Amitabh has been a Cong MP in 80s.

Then was close to Amar Singh and SP in later 90s and early 200s. Wife is still SP MP.

Became close to Modi when he started to rise.

Now hearing he's going back to cong as we speak.

 Ambani bhool gaye Sudhir Chaudhary - Zee TV. Prakash Raj - Congress  Prannoy Roy, Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose - all Congress  i have been curious about this. most americans openly identify with one of the two (mostly) political parties... i wonder if it means that they are officially a member of that party or they just prefer them over others... it would have been nice if this was the case here as well. would have been easier to decide who to avoid and who not to looking at how things are here in this country.  Many people on here seem to misunderstand the word ""bias"". Opposing a current govt is *not* bias. Refusing to sing praises of the present govt is *not* bias. Bringing to attention where a govt has fallen short is *not* bias.

In fact, it's the job of the media to keep the ruling party in check. To remind the public that all is not well. To maintain transparency. To expose the liars.

Things that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).

Also, people are allowed to have opinions. Vishal Dadlani is not someone who needs to be neutral; he's not a public servant or a newsman. The question of bias is not relevant here at all. Randeep Hooda, Virender Sehwag - BJP Me What is this for? End purpose? Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys is a rabid BJP supporter, just like most bigots in India. A-grade hypocrite too. Gautam Gambhir- BJP I only started following politics after the Nuclear Deal, so don't have historical opinions.

As far as I know they are hosting an entire event based on the hashtag, it wouldn't be long till people start screaming the hashtag around couples who just want to spend some time together. 

This just feels weird.

Edit : #PyaarEkDhokhaHai translates to #LoveIsBetrayal
Mostly targeted towards singles who are frustrated about not having a date for Valentine's.",BacchaYadav," Yep, yet another ""let's get viral"" tactic, looks like.  It was ok at first but now it feels forced. Tanmay Butt if you're reading this, tu sannyas le bhai.  World is coming closer to Black Mirror day by day!
Episode: Hated in the Nation I agree.

I don't mind the hashtag, but the event and all is stretching it. It just sounds kinda stupid and weak to me. Bhaiyya toh kya samjhe ki youtube pe intellectuals milenge?  Unsubscribed from AIB's channel a long time ago, quiet happy. [deleted] I'll happily debate anyone who says PyarEkDhokhaHai

Because I've experienced the opposite What does PyaarEkDhokhaHai  even mean?? Mediocrity sells and AIB are doing a good job at it . Guess now they are the Salman Khan of YouTube. Never followed them or such. They are for urban teenagers who don't have a sense of humour and don't know words beyond bhencho.

 Exactly! It’s just silly IMO  I was thinking this while going through their Instagram story as well. Kinda seems like an exercise in futility.  Please tell me it is just a joke and not an actual event that people are attending.  If someone provides the translation I can also decide to outrage.  To Be Honest, The whole bashing of couples and the Valentine's Day/Week was fine until a certain point. Making light-hearted memes, cracking poor jokes was fine. But this whole hashtag and the upcoming events planned by AIB and others is meaningless and capitalises on the frustration of singles who can't get into a relationship despite desperately wanting to! I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this but I think it's a very clever marketing strategy. At the and end of the day AIB is a brand and they seem to have figured out a viral branding technique cashing in on the large pool of single people who are active on social media.    
   
I'd also like to ask everyone calling them the personification of mediocrity to give me some examples of good Indian brands in the content space.  Can anyone fill me in on what it's about?


Also ,fuck AIB, mediocrity personified. They're finally living up to their name, in a literal way. they have sponsors. Don't take this shit seriously Can we stop having self derogatory memes until a point people seriously start believing it and trouble/judge others if they talk about having a better experience?   

I mean, I have never dated hell I am shy as fuck if I need to approach a girl but I know it will work if I want it to work and try to make myself a decent human being. I don't even get it. Is it supposed to be ironical? Sarcastic? Commentary on regressive society? AIB is still a thing? Finally somebody said it!! Hosting an entire event on that is just too ridiculous. Atleast screaming the hashtag around couples seems like a fun idea to me."

All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence. Life is unfair, dude. That's the simplest way to look at it. I feel like you quite a lot, but then what makes me stop thinking this way is when I see daily wage laborers or these people who do odd jobs, no matter how hard they work, they will never have a comfortable life. I start to think, how would they feel when they look at us.

I'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.

I feel you.

I really do.
An ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).

I know what you're going through.

I find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. 

I made myself. You'll too. 

Men want just one thing dude. And that one thing is disgusting. Men just want Man Samman.

Its all that will ever matter.

I hope this helped. Life is different for everybody and in every aspect. Why wasting time and mindfulness on comparing yourself to someone else. What do you want? What will you have to do to achieve it? Fuck rest of the world and work on that.

And yes, please change the scale which you use to measure happiness. A Mercedes is happiness for 2 days. Inner satisfaction is the key. Get their. Life doesn’t owe you anything. Life doesn’t have to be fair, life doesn’t have to be unfair. It is what it is. There is no logic or rewards systems with life. Sometimes you get what you deserve and other times you don’t, this can either be good or bad. 

All you can do is, put in your best and hope you don’t get a hot pile of shit in return. C’est la vie. "

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? [deleted] [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant.

I ask her about her day, make her laugh, help her out but all this seems to have put in the friend zone.

I understand she’ll need some time but what can I do to make her look at me not just as a friend?  Can’t really ask her to go on a date or something because we both are day scholars and this is a town in india we’re talking about.

5. i was her tampon: check

exactly, thats what you'll be: a tampon, learnt that the hard way, quit her in 2015 after getting tired of her back and forth bullshit and uncertainty, she ll keep you locked but she wont say say, fuck that shit man, no one s got time for that... She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge. She will use your shoulder to cry on and find some other guy's dick to ride on.

I know it sounds rude, but its just the way the world works. Always better to learn the lesson early in life. Tell her your feelings either she says yes or friendship ends. Or she knows and keeps the friendship which is painful. And everyone knows.

Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles? 

",finalbeer," Send the Port message. They will immediately call you. I had this problem a lot. I was skeptical at first but it turned out that it was an App that had ads which would get activated even though I didn't tap on them. It was Boost For Reddit in my case. Now I avoid using it. Are you using any app that has ads at the bottom?  I am in the same boat as you, except I have postpaid. I emailed them and  threatened to not pay the bill and threatened to go to their competitiors if they continue the nonsense of adding VAS charges (which they added 366 rupees this month when my usual bill is 360 Rupees!). They said they will credit the same in the next bill cycle. I suspect they are lying. So I shot back an email saying I want it done for the bill I am about to pay this month. It looks like they have obliged. But, I won't be sticking around with them anymore. They do it all the time. Register a written complaint via email, it works everytime, also it means that those who cannot send email and are not assertive enough (read most of the people) will not get there balance back and will have to way to stop further wrongful deductions. I think this is deliberate and standard operating procedure of the telcos. They do it all the time.

> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS’s undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had “no politics” and would remain “devoted purely to cultural work” (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel’s pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s January 30, 1948 assassination**.

> ... On November 14, 1948, the Home Ministry held by Patel issued a press note which said Golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the government’s demand that the RSS reform itself. Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed “**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past…**”

> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “**objectionable part**” which “**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans …” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …**” Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.**” Well. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.  (Don’t remember who said that, but it fits here) Any lawyers around? Is it possible for a court to cast out the leadership of RSS and give control of the organization to an external administration? If an organization is clearly in breach of its charter and principles, and the current governance structure takes no notice.. surely that’s grounds for dismissing the leadership? So, complain to Sardar Patel? ;)

You need to pay gst then file for a refund  Payments in any foreign currency will come under export category on which IGST is applicable even for Rs 100 so you will have to register for GST  Our CA told me that we could fetch a bank guarantee and that would allow us to not file and pay every month. That can be an annual process. So that's what I'm in the process of doing right now. 

I would say talk to your CA. I don't do affiliate marketing, but I get my payments in USD to my bank account, it's a similar situation. I am in the exact same position as yours.. I haven't sorted the GST thing... How do you do your income tax returns.  How did you become an affiliate? Check with a CA dont pay tax directly and ask for refund. CA knows this better.

Non-Political,[Non Political][Serious]To all Indian women: What do you think of an Indian guy who has payed for sex? Would you marry him?,32,4cdae5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4cdae5/non_politicalseriousto_all_indian_women_what_do/,288,1459243861.0,I know this is a re-post of the question. I accidentally deleted the question. I am not trying to troll anyone. I am genuinely looking for opinions. ,Indiandude_throwaway," Hahahahahahahah you actually think there are women on Randia?

And if they are, they'd risk replying to you? DAILY SAXX THREAD strangely all males are answering this question which has been addressed for females specifically payed....?? [deleted] I honestly find it a bit sad. No, I wouldn't date or marry him.  I would marry a girl who is a prostitute if I love her. There is your answer.

And paying for sex doesn't make you any different from a normal guy, if a girl is turned off by this, she is too narrow minded don't marry her. It's a societal jinx, the catch 22/ Pandora's box.

When we are young we are brash and we do things which we wouldn't otherwise, no one should hold that against you.  High quality Red Pill stuff and quite cliche as well.. But I shall still repeat: 'Men use love to get sex and women use sex for getting love'. 

I don't think women would mind her guy indulging into emotionless sex.. Its the romantic involvement of men with other women which pisses her off.. But again, its not a thumb rule. Over possessive women can create a tantrum and ruin it. 

 [deleted] well women can have sex if they want it.Finding a partner is no big deal but for a guy it is. Its not that easy.    I think it's disgusting, so no. Can't marry someone whose morals don't match yours.  girl here..It would be a huge turn off. It is a sign that he is not able to attract women. It is an almost deal breaker Do you really think marrying means you're not paying for sex? Nice try lol When a girl/boy is blindly in love, it doesn't what the partner has done in the past. She/he will even put up with his carelessness, brash attitude etc., all in the name of love.       This type of question arises partly because of the ""arranged married"" background where a lot of ""judging"" happens before two people actually gets to know each other. 

Perhaps if 'arranged marriages' never happened in India, this question would be like 'do you knowingly date a guy who has paid for sex before'. Which is again an individual choice, but since you wouldn't know if a person has done that or not without getting to know that person a lot, you will be better placed to make a good call knowing all aspects of that person (rather than if they are X cast, gothra, and how strong/week is their family and what not). Dude if you want a genuine answer, ask this question on Quora and not Reddit. 

 [deleted] i'd say the context is important.  i can't say one way or another until i know more details.  in the end, if it is all in the past and the baggage is lost, one may perhaps be persuaded to move on.  

i'd also be interested to know what the guy feels about marrying a woman who has received money to have sex.  A friend of mine(he says the story was about a friend, but he knows too many details). A close friend of mine told me he lost his virginity this way. I am actually quite proud of him. If the urge is too strong, go pay someone and do it consentually. 

And if you want to know, yes I do find him attractive.  Having had a chat with many women about this subject, let me offer a perspective. 

The responses you will get will be most likely be negative. Said guy is a loser, etc or on the SJW side - oppression of women and what not.

However, the deeper reason for this is defensive feelings which arise from the fact that prostitution simply puts a price on pussy, and takes away all the enigma and value from it. 

Men chase women and jump through hoops for them and put up with a lot of their bullshit with the ultimate goal of sleeping with them at some point or continuing to sleep with them. Acting as gatekeepers of sex is the 'power' that women have in a male dominated society, and to every woman, in her head, to get sex from her a man must be 'worthy' of it and must do things to remain worthy. 

Now what if, men suddenly stopped caring, and just bought their way into pussy anywhere from 3000 - 20000 bucks a pop? It completely negates the power they have, and hence they feel defensive and would want to dismiss/discredit such men in any way possible. [deleted] [deleted] If the roles are reserved, then no. If a girl has to pay for sex, then either she is too ugly to get any dick or too slutty, not getting enough dicks. Either case, not worth it.

And if a guy fucks a pros, I don't think it is a problem unless you get STDs or something. People falling in love with prostitutes is not that common, as bollywood makes you believe. Girl here. I have a friend who's paid for sex before, does it occasionally.   
  
Answering this would be tough for anyone because the industry is largely exploitative, but without customers those women don't have an income and are left more vulnerable to exploitation and poverty. The job and its income gives (some) women (some sort of) financial independence.   
  
I'd want to know why the guy paid for sex, who the woman was, how they interacted, and what he thought of the experience. If he chose to have unprotected sex, seemed to disrespect the woman (or sex workers in general), and was sexually/physically abusive, I wouldn't want to date him. If he treated it like any other service transaction and dealt with the service provider with dignity, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.   Are you thinking of getting a tatto kya - 'Paid for sex' :) "

/s Phir shuru ho gaye bhencho. Yeh saaley thaktey nahin hein is sab chutiyappe se? Bas karo maaiyavon... Rajnath Singh, and other such idiots in the BJP, should just shut the fuck up. Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie.

How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches.

Science/Technology,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,7,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,1532391253.0,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",kasam_se," why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. "

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

Why don't we start exporting such idi0ts?   So is Arabic or Chinese (with pinyin that dictates precise tone) or Greek. Shameful to have such bigoted idiots as our leaders.

  My first language is Sanskrit, it did help me a LOT to easily learn other Indian languages. But this is blind pandering. If only he knew Sanskrit is a Indo-European language and its getting impractical due to its lack of adaptation to modern terminologies.

  Just wasting tax money on futile efforts of promoting on one language, building expensive statues etc . First feed the hungry farmers and 1/3rd of world's poor in India.

 These leaders have their children educated in Oxford and Cambridge, but want Indians to waste time to please these guys vote bank.

   Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

> * Be it art, literature, science or technology, people are admitting Sanskrit is most useful,"" Singh said addressing the launch of a ""Mahaabhiyan"" to take Sanskrit to every house which is being led by an educational institution here.He said that even Nasa, while building a super computer, had said that Sanskrit was the most suitable language for it.

> * ""But the irony is that we are getting away from it in India,"" he said.Singh said that Sanskrit does not have a problem of spelling like other languages, such as English, and was pronounced in a similar manner everywhere.

> * Unlike other languages, where pronunciation varies from region to region, Sanskrit does not have this problem as it is based on sound science, he added.

> * ""Even youths in the US and UK are reading Sanskrit,"" he said.Singh said that as during his stint as the education minister in Uttar Pradesh government, he had introduced two chapters on Vedic mathematics in the school curriculum which, however, were later removed by the subsequent governments.He said that if there was the will, knowledge of Sanskrit could be taken to each and every house.

Science/Technology,"OnlineRTI on Twitter: ""RTI CIC appointment - Modi Government invites anyone with wide experience in law, science, technology etc.""",45,2k9t1b,https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI/status/525916977898860544,8,1414253489.0,,onlinerti," The Central Information Commission, the Court for hearing RTI cases, has been left without a Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) for almost a month.

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance. 

This is the first time appointment of CIC is not based on seniority and based on merits.


DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

[Survey],12,27alsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/27alsc/how_satisfied_are_you_with_your_childs_exposure/,35,1401921808.0,"I am interested in what /r/india parents (and even others) think about the quality of their child's exposure to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).  Please help me by answering a short survey here: [http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U](http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U).

I'll post the results of this survey here on /r/India in a few days.

Disclosure: I am with an NGO committed to improving the quality of STEM exposure in India.  We will use your responses to guide our future activities.  You can learn more about us through our first activity --- a science fair in Bangalore --- here [http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/](http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/)",happy_elephant," From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. 

Problem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. 

Alternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.

school jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/

I support you..very nice initiative.

but..isko escape velocity nahi bolna tha..you know there's special joke of this on r/India. Don't Indian kids already have an overdose of science and academics?  You should be working to expose them to more sports and arts and literature. Your website is really ordinary.  

How much does it cost to get a really high quality website made?  50k? 

Surely you can afford that much money."

>""During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

> THE FACTS
> 
> * Originally from India and Pakistan, Basmati became a controversial ‘issue’ after RiceTec, a Texas-based company, in 1997, patented some types of rice they developed as “American basmati”.
> * RiceTec Inc, had been trying to enter the international Basmati market with brands like “Kasmati” and “Texmati”. Ultimately, the company claimed to have developed a new strain of aromatic rice by interbreeding basmati with another variety. They sought to call the allegedly- new variety as Texmati or American Basmati.
> * RiceTec Inc, was issued the Patent number 5663484 on Basmati rice lines and grains on September 2, 1997.
> * This was objected to by two Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) — Centre for Food Safety, an international NGO that campaigns against biopiracy, and the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, an Indian environmental NGO who filed legal petitions in the United States. The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research also

> * They sought trade protection for basmati rice of the Indian subcontinent and jasmine rice of

> * The Indian government, after putting together the evidence, officially challenged the patent in June 2000.

Recently i believe there was news of a company trying to patent pattals or leaf bowls and plates there which we use for prashad and bhandara. Every time someone tells me about why patenting is good for inventors and protects their interests which is kind of true, I remind them of all the ways it’s abused and used to bully actual pioneers who just aren’t aware of the law. Anyone who has prepared for NEET knows the story [deleted] They even tried to patent our 'Pranayama'; they got it renamed to 'Cardiac Coherence Breathing'. Ain't this old news? I've seen these Texmati  and American Basmati rice in 10 kg bags at Walmart when I went to Canada in 2007.

Science/Technology,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,10,bwmz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,1559671479.0,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?,4,cj7xx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cj7xx0/what_is_the_future_of_artificial_intelligence_and/,1,1564414128.0," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year. 

One simple computer vision app can replace this entire job function (when I was working there, there were around 10 others who were doing the same thing, with different components)"
Science/Technology,To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,1558060692.0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",arkoprovo1996,
Science/Technology,Need help with depression and anger.,9,7yz12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,1519186110.0,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",officialshebu," Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now. Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   


**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**

**You Go out there and Kill it**

All the Best :)  Man! This brings back memories.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.


Did you watch Black Panther? It's super cool.

Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",45,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,1461592127.0,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

",hganjoo," So it's basically a fridge. >and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the ""engineering"" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.
",Responsbile_Indian," Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front.

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",nerds_revenge," Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it."

Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Edit. Join /r/atheismindia for more discussion on leaving your faith and coming back to the real world.

Dear r/all please do take the time to know about the recent religious riots happening in the Capital city delhi /r/India",pking3," I don't think ""atheist"" or ""none"" is an option under the official column of religions in India. So if you are born in a Muslim family you'll forever be a Muslim, unless you convert to some other religion. There are officially no ""atheists"" in India. We need to change this and develop the atheist culture in India. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then He is not omnipotent.

Is He able, but not willing?
Then He is malevolent.

Is He both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?

Is He neither able nor willing?
Then why call Him God?

#Pure Comedy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*~Father John Misty*  

The comedy of man starts like this  
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe  
They're at the center of everything  
And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with  
Until there's nothing human left  
Just random matter suspended in the dark  
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got Religion is the main cause of unrest in India. Religion is one intense fandom. [deleted] Religion is legalised madness

Edit: Thank you for the shining silver kind stranger. To all those parents and students who called Moral Science classes a sham, this is why we needed it. Religion is an expired product that has continued to stay. It should have been eradicated or died a while back but has not. If we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion. Any existing religion is like Superman, did wonders on paper but doesn't actually exists. “When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”

― Jiddu Krishnamurti


Questioner :  Kindly give a straight reply. Does god exist, or not? Yes, or no? If yes, how best to realize him in this life?

JK : ""If you examine very closely, you have created god. Right? In India there are about – I was told there are about 300,000 gods and more. (Laughs) You understand? Every local person has his own god.

So, sirs, we have created god. See the irony of it. Thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created. Which is, to worship oneself and call it god. You understand all this? – the better part of you is god. Right? I wonder if you understand this. First of all, let’s be clear. Have you created god? The local gods round the corner, or the local god in Rome, or in Tirupati, or wherever, you have created them, haven’t you? You are so very uncertain, aren’t you, so frightened. If you say we have created, then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that. Out of your fear you want security. Right? You want safety, you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid. You follow? So you create that, and then worship that. Just see what you are doing! Going to Tirupati and putting all your money in the bag – do you think gods want your money? Sir, look at it all. You have nothing to offer but money, garlands, prostrations, rituals. Right? You have nothing else to offer. Have you realised the tragedy of this, sirs?

If you love – not god, that’s very easy to love god because it is an abstraction, it has not much meaning. But if you love, that very love is god, that very love is sacred. You won’t go outside to look for god. You understand all this, sirs!

And the questioner wants to know if I believe in god. I don’t. Because god is something created by man. There is such a thing as eternity, which is to be outside of time. Right, sir? For that you must have a mind, a heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life. Right? From your vanity, your arrogance, your selfishness – you follow, sir? And we say, we are not capable of it, tell us what to do. You are back in the cycle, somebody to tell you what to do. Sir, you are in a jungle, you have to walk through it by yourself. Right? And for that you need vitality and vigour and strength. Not belief in god, in goodness – belief has no place where truth is concerned. Right?"" If you need divine  reward to do something good or you have fear if you do something bad something bad will happen I think your are a piece of shit. Just be kind to the people help them if you can and for the world sake stop protecting your religion. This post is pure gold!
Religion destroys humanity not build it. All cast system, racism, homophobia and misogynims have their roots in religion.
Just fuck religion and you'll bring out the best in humans!!

God is like that 'Baba' we use to scare kids with so they won't do anything that is denied. \*reads title\* : Ahhh , I see you are a man of culture as well It's really my imaginary friend is so much better than yours. We're not going to get blown out in a supernova, the sun's too little. Religion is a massive waste of time. It has outlived it's utility. This is why i believe in my made up God-

Dovah- A dragon from Skyrim I personally believe that religion is for those weak minded people who can't face the music and always need some kind of support (was one of them). There was this really nice quote from MIB- ""An individual is a smart person. Perfectly capable of making his own decisions, rational etc. but crowd on the other hand is violent, easy to provoke, and has nothing but a common herd mentality."" Now don't get me wrong. I do read sometime bits and pieces of religious text which are some really well thought out philosophical texts but let us be real. There always be a motherfucker who's gonna distort everything and use gullible people to support his own propaganda by exploiting their concept of belief. 

So preach father and preach it hard. Fucking hell fuck all religions. All they have ever done is divided us, and taken advantage of by opportunistic old politicians. And our childish adults should take as much blame for that. We’re literally standing on the verge of global environmental collapse with highest levels of inequality and unemployment with a massively flawed education system and all they can talk about is their mandirs and masjids with no regard for what the future generations would go through. This. This right here!! Fuckkk all religion!!!! The bane of mankind Not just religion, any ideology that overtakes your identity as a human being is dangerous.



Be it the religious wars that were fought, to the dictators who mass murdered people in keeping to their beliefs, everywhere people collectively stood behind an ideology that shadowed their human identity.



Don't believe in ideologies rather believe and hope that tomorrow when a mob of these a$$f##king c@@ts come to lynch you, there'll be atleast one amongst them questioning what he's doing and changes his mind about his beliefs.



Or if you are privileged enough, you could just live in harmony, clapping and cheering, watching while these c@@ts kill themselves. /S Remove religion from schools (prayers) and we have a chance at better future I am going through same frustration bro , where are the so called foking almighty God who are immortal , or are they the ones doing this, them fok them . 
 
Guys tell me one benefit in believing in religion ? Does it save u from these riots ? Which is happening in the name of it .
Does it make people disciplined? Then who are these goons who are Killing in the name of religion ? 

I guess it was just an fiction story written by a man , and later after centuries people started thinking it as thier past and that it was all real . Just imagine after centuries if somehow someone reads marvel comics or harry potter or any such fiction story and actually believe in them thinking it as real thing from past. 

 I wish people one day no longer believes in it . Man made god,not the other way around. [Religion is like a Penis](https://i.imgur.com/V4gTSiO.jpg) We can't ban religions but we should start banning religion backed schools / madarshas Fuck god. I’m better without it. All we are to them are just Paying FANBOYS of their poorly written ""SciFi franchise""...
  -Mr.R0bot(about religion) Wanted to gift an award, but i m poor ☹️. Very well written. I have the same ideology. Hope so people stop this mass brutality in the name of religion. It wouldn't have been a real problem if everyone minded their own bussiness. ""Nothing divides us except religion"" Are you sure about that..? 🤔 Religion is a way for humans to escape reality. It makes people feel as if they are part of something bigger. In reality they are nothing, and they cant accept that. Its way too easy to think they are part of god's plan rather than a blob of hydrocarbons.

Religion is just a theory that was believed for so long that when better theories which proved religion false came along people couldnt accept it. Wrong sub my man. Most in this sub are sensible enough to know this. Should probably post it somewhere where people are deluded. People who are using incendiary rhetoric and inciting violence to meet their agenda are not in this sub. The intricate reality of these cults are far more complex to find a universal solution(for now) than saying ""fuck all religion"" on the internet. Religions will fade away,it will take time though. Until then, it's what it is. If it wasn't for religion, it would be caste or nationalism....for some reason being a human isnt enough and we feel a need to form smaller communities      
Haven't come up with what a possible solution looks like but at the least it should include critical thinking in kids and stopping religious indoctrination There is no better way to make people who have no beef in the first place hate each other to the point of committing genocide than through religion. Religion, is just a flawed philosophy. There's is nothing special in it. Religion is a mental illness. Why on earth would want to associate with them? Blech. Let them kill each other and some day they’ll all be gone. https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190801-tomorrows-gods-what-is-the-future-of-religion

 Rest of the world fighting with coronavirus. Religion is the opium of the masses. Forget about the bloody Gods and listen to what I am telling you - Margery Tyrell A hallucinatic person said something about religion which made so much sense to me. 

""If I don't believe in my imagenary friend, why the hell should I believe in yours?"" ~ Elliot Anderson Good rant I could not agree more - my hats off to my Indian brothers and sisters in the struggle against the zealots Keep spreading the truth.  Let's turn all religions into mythology again. religion was invented by smart rulers to control dumb people, and its something that's sadly never going to change. when you teach a child something, the older they get the harder it is for you to change their mind, and when they have kids of their own they teach them the same thing and it becomes an amplification loop. we live in a world where people take incredible luxuries for granted because thats what we're born with. the modern world allows dumb people to be loud and grab the attention of other dumb people who think the same, something that was never possible before. for god's sake just look at all the anti science movements, you can calculate the speed of light using a microwave and a chocolate bar but if they don't believe it it doesn't exist. people who think this way dont want to know the truth, they want what they think is the truth to be the truth and when that line of thinking combines with conflicting opinions all hell breaks loose. Careful not to cut yourself on all that edge. Disclaimer first: I am 100% an atheist.

Having said that, the problem isn't religion in and of itself.

Most religious teachings usually boil down to 'care about others' and 'be a decent person'. Yes, there's a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well, not denying that. But a lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs, and you saying they should just let go of it because it's illogical and dumb, is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics. Religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning. I remember asking a religion teacher in school which is correct: The Big Bang or God made the world. She told me 'Both. The Big Bang happened, but God made it happen (obvs not something I believe, but not the point is) She also reiterated that the Bible is not literal. And she was a nun. And, as you may have heard, Einstein believed in God too. So, again, it's possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist.

Organised religion is absolutely a problem. In my transition from Roman Catholic to atheist, I had a 'I believe in God, but not in the Church' phase. Religious organisations can be corrupt to the core. People twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are a problem. People using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others (like being against the LGBTQ community, or anti vaxxers, or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed) are a problem. But religious people who use religion to find personal comfort, help others, and be part of a community? There is nothing wrong with that.

Yes, I still believe the world would be better off without religion, because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name. But it is not my, or your, or anyone's place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully. Because, again, if you do this, it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives. Amen Stop talking sense. true fuck religion Thank god I'm an atheist. Yes, all religions are fairy tales. Yes, no religion has any definitive proof of being true.

But there is one point people here are missing. Religion does give people mental peace and a purpose to live especially when things are not going their way. While it gives people a false sense of hope that makes them believe that things will get better, it does keep them resilient during tough times. People want easy answers to questions and religion gives it to them. We may be rational in thinking that we can embrace tough times by just moving forward and waiting for things to become better but others are not. They can easily get depressed and go through mental problems.

People who derive pride from their religion go too far. To solve that they need to be educated and given fulfilling work. This won't stop them from being religious but it will at least give them a genuine reason to be proud.

If you want to do away with religion you need to first solve mental health problems.

Just my 2 cents. Exactly. And fuck nationalism. None of us chose these lives/bodies that we are living in. Neither did the person you hate, choose this life for himself

Borders were created by us and it’s something very abstract. Fighting and killing others for something like this seems very stupid to me.

Then I would like to measure several parameters gdp, income, freedom of speech, etc. 

I am really curious what the results will be. It's always been a way to control people. It can be argued that it brought many people together in the good ol' days. The world wasn't so much connected back then. Your entire life would be spent in a 10km radius where it would be rare to find someone who believes in a different imaginary being. So it brought everyone together by believing things larger than themselves.

But the in last century, since everyone is so connected, finding a person who believes in some other imaginary being is too easy. And that's where the human group psychology acts against us and forms groups. It becomes Us vs Them. Religion is unnecessary in our society. But I don't think it should be irradiated or banned.

I think the ideal way to deal with this would be to just keep what metaphysical thing you believe in to yourself. Yes This is why THANOS was right! Wait till you hear about capitalism classism Imagine being an adult who holds faith in their omnipotent imaginary friend as described in a thrice-translated collection of oral histories collected over 1500 years ago, regarding events that happened hundreds of years before they were written down.

You know, the Inuit believe that the earth was created by Raven. The difference: I know ravens exist. Post this on a chintu sub and witness the dislikes Yesss fuck them. Fuck all of them. Every fucking government form I've ever filled asks for my religion. Be it university or a public sector job. I despise the idea that my belief system is somehow relevant to my performance as a student or as an employee. I make it a point to write ""n/a"" in that section, no matter what the repercussions. 

Iirc once a public college even asked my caste. Ffs my caste, and no, not from reservation point of view, just under personal information. Religion is nothing but a tool to control a large number of people by the people in power or those who pretend to be the representative of the religion.
It was used by hitler to justify the heinous crime even tho no sane mind would agree this level of torture for a fellow human.it was used by evangelist Christian Europeans who plundered lands of other n descredited their culture along with subjecting them to discrimination.It was used by isis fighter who were so islamic that they made burkha mandatory for all woman in their area n came with motto to defend islam but themselves raped in every village they went n even killing fellow muslims.it is now being used by the  rss n bjp to polarise the people n antagonize the whole muslim community on pretext of ages old of their own made up history n encouraging lynchings through bajrang dals ,inciting violence.it is still being used by few godmen who even with rape charges against them n property worth of 100s of crore people support them blindly n anybody even dare to criticize them is declared the enemy of the whole community. I feel you man, Im gonna start college this year and am really afraid to go to Delhi to study, all it would take is one person to accuse someone of being a Hindu or a Muslim for a bloodbath that to start that police will probably ignore I truly believe in the not too distant future that the belief of religion will be classified as a mental illness. It’s CRAZY to me that when you go back and read some of the different religious texts it’s chock full of holes and usually rely on “prophets” speaking/ having visions of *insert deity here* to get the message across. That shit sounds like textbook schizophrenia but because no one knew what that was they just accepted it as truth. Now here we are thousands of years later, millions killed in the name of religion and people STILL BELIEVE THIS BULLSHIT. *sorts by controversial,* *grabs popcorn* A fellow atheist popping in,

As I've said before, if God does exist, he doesnt deserve our worship because of the unnecessary suffering this donkey allows in his name or without. God, either shape up and help, or fuck the right off. Religion is like having a dick. It's fine to have one, but it's NOT ok to shove into other people especially children. I'm agnostic, and dislike all religions, but this reads like it belongs to r/iamverysmart. Or r/iam14andthisisdeep Let's get this straight, there are a lot of things that divide us other than religion. It is in our nature to do it. 

Religion is not bad. It's believing that your religion is better than all the others, or your god is superior to the other gods is what is the problem. I am not religious and I agree with you on most points. I want to believe that the abolishment of all religions is the answer to most of the problems of humanity. But, here is a thought. What about the countries with the most non-religious people? China, Czech, UK... Can we really say they are perfect? China has 90% of people who are non-believers. Can we really say they are in a better state than us?

Religion is a problem. But maybe the bigger problem is basic human nature which is to be selfish and divisive. Yes buddy the problem is religion. Not corruption, theft, incompetence, maladministration, colonial laws, red tape, power cuts, absence of health care, undrinkable water, no water, rabies, typhoid, malaria, dengue, PM10, unlivable cities, unsustainable cost of living, ridiculous salaries, sewage in the water, inability of the state and judicial system to catch or punish any kind of criminal at any level, all of which lead to the majority of people living in a permanent state of despair. No, the only problem is religion. Let's get rid of that and everything will be perfect. Great solution. Of course you are right. Nice work. Now go cure cancer b***d. If God does exist, he is having a laughing riot now. 

And yeah, fuck religion. Bruh so edgy, wow. Fuck Christian
Christian: Well, Hello. “If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only be to make us larger, freer and more loving. If God cannot do this, then it is time **we got rid of Him.**” -- james baldwin. ""Faith in God is the purposeful *suspension* of critical thinking"" - Bill Maher Also... Fuck Moash I do not believe in any god whatsoever,but I do believe that if people want to,they should.
If something provides them with an anchor,a sense of relief,then why force them out of it?
But of course,I 100% agree with your point of mass killings due to religion,and I'd also like to add to it that the concept of religion has been a major hindrance in our development as well.
All in all I'm just saying if people want to practice religion,they should,but,they should be accepting of other religions and learn to live in peace. I do not believe in this modern world commercial religion shit and have distanced myself from religion since 15 years now.
The thing is, it doesn't matter in India.
I used to live in Gurgaon, and was asked my name numerous times (even in front of my house) by random people who then started fighting(non verbal fights) with me just because its a persian name. 
I live in Toronto now, and noone gives a shit about your religion here (unless you decide to live in Indian/pakistani/bangladeshi ghettos again).
The thing is, it doesn't matter what your faith or philosophy is, when the crowd of fanatics comes at your door, they will kill you. There is no reason with these people, and to be honest its more related to the wealth gap between rich and poor. The poor have rage in them, they have cell phones with cheap internet and big families with nothing to do, so in their mind, power is in numbers and force is only way to get things done.
Seriously fuck this society.
Edit:word Lol looks like somebody just figured it out No matter how peaceful your religion is, the world will never be in peace with religion in it. Religion is the most dangerous disease, weapon and mental illness in this world. The main cause behind most wars, look at world war II, Nazis were predominantly Christians.... Hated Jews for killing their Lord... Thank you for this post. r/redditmoment My opinion on religion?
It was created to control the people. While watching the Hindu nationalists go insane in India this is all I can think about. We have to kill religion. Pakistani here.

We really are in shock over what has started happening.
We send our thoughts and prayers for all of you.

I'm already an athiest who promotes humanity more than anything. 
All religions tell you to do better to gods or entities creation first. This is just ungodly and non human violence.

I hope this ends soon. I hope people get out safe One day religion will die off and humanity will be free from its lies. Religion is the biggest con ever Finally someone who makes sense. I also agree that the religion and the caste system is absolute bullshit Here is the really amazing speech from Mr.Robot questioning religion.


""Is that what God does? He helps? Tell me, why didn't God help my innocent friend who died for no reason while the guilty ran free? 

Okay. Fine. Forget the one offs. How about the countless wars declared in his name? 

Okay. Fine. Let's skip the random, meaningless murder for a second, shall we? How about the racist, sexist, phobia soup we've all been drowning in because of him?

And I'm not just talking about Jesus. I'm talking about all organized religion. Exclusive groups created to manage control. A dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope. His followers, nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance. 

Addicts. Afraid to believe the truth. That there's no order. There's no power. That all religions are just metastasizing mind worms, meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that wanna run us. All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly-written sci-fi franchise. If I don't listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours? People think their worship's some key to happiness. That's just how he owns you. Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality. So fuck God. He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.""

- Elliot Alderson (Mr.Robot Season 2 Episode 3) I agree.

My parents(Hindus) always said that I must pray to God every day and shit like that but honestly, I didn't think there was any sense in that. Even in my school assemblies when everyone would vow their heads in prayer(I went to a Christian school) I would just stand there with my head up. I never felt that there was any use of prayer. Amen I'm 17 y/o and I am sure I can live without your fairytale. Call it bragging but I'm just gonna go ahead and consider myself much better than majority of adult population. I am also a vegan. I have questioned my life far and wide and I think everyone should go through the process of self evaluation. 
Please do it. Do it for us. The future generations. this entire thread is a huge r/redditmoment lmao Religion makes many people look at eachother as sub humans. We dont matter in the grand scheme of things but it is worth it to be good to eachother to protect the little we have. Religion causes so much pain and harm to innocent families. I don't hate religious people at all. I understand WHY some people believe but its just a fact the world would be a better place without it. Even Satanists? 

https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets Atheists are just people who admit we don't know how the universe works but we believe scientists  are closer to the answers to the universe than the priests are. I've never understood the mental gymnastics some of you religious apes use to justify your beliefs. I have highly educated intelligent family members who believe in all the fucking cultural pseudoscience. 

Atheism isn't a choice, it's a symptom of a functioning brain. Amazing. Tell others to be open minded. Then ask them to live exactly the way you want them too. 



Fuck you too Valid points. But my religion has helped me become a better person, treat others with respect regardless of their religion and the colour of their skin, give charity, be a productive member of the society and most of all it gives me hope.

The problem is not religion, its extremism. Religious people are literally patients of a brainwashing cult that has incepted 'anti-human' idea and tradition in their brain All right it's time to address the usual rebuttals.

""We need Religion for emotional and spiritual values""

You can hire a therapist for emotional support and simply buy a good telescope to look at the night sky, nothing is more spiritual than gazing at a clear night sky.

""In 20th century more people died by Nazis and commies who were atheists""

Nazis were not atheists, they were Christians who traditionally hated Jews (even the Protestants hate Jews, just look into Martin Luther's verses). Communists were atheists but weren't just entirely atheists. Its the classic saying, a communist can be an atheist but not all atheists are communist (especially proletarian dictatorship).

""You cannot ignore the good things that religious people do.""

You can do good things without being religious, there's this thing called humanity you know. 

""Being an atheist doesn't mean you're a good person""

Precisely the point, atheism is simply an absence of belief in a God and doesn't explain anything about a person's political or social inclinations. There were and are many bad atheists but unlike theist folks an atheist doesn't need to defend that evil person merely because they share that one specific philosophy.

""You cannot just remove religion like it does nothing""

That's true, religion does offer many good things. But as I said earlier, you can offer all those good things without invoking an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God.

""Atheists are just too arrogant""

Theists claim to know the mind of the omnipotent being which created this entire universe and yet atheists are the arrogant ones... Right.

""Religion and atheism are incompatible""

Not entirely true, it depends on one's definition of religion. If a religion doesn't need a God as a criterion then technically you can be an atheist and be part of a religion. Again atheism only means the absence of belief in a God, nothing more nothing less. Amen I think we're stuck between a fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and a rightwing that wants to install a tyranny of the majority. When the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone, I don't think, we, people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms. After all these years since we said our good byes to British, we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them. I don't see a near future where people can see through shit and have a true democracy. It's sad, but it's also a painful truth. Chinese are atheists and look at their treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans, Hongkong, Taiwan etc... Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people by marx Well you know what they say: religion is the opium of the masses. I personally vibe the concept of faith and I can definitely see why people would be drawn to a belief, be it imaginary or not to sustain thoughts of afterlife and a greater existence. However, I hate the concept of religion as an institution. Religion has become an institution to control and generate profits and set its own agenda. Its an archaic institution that isn’t needed in the 21st century ʻOumuamua, take me away from this planet You should check out anti-theism. Btw totally agreeing with every single letter. I couldn't say it any better then this. Fuck Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and their other spin offs. YES PLEASE If you don't want to accept death, that's fine. Focus your efforts on achieving immortality. Decide that you will live forever or die trying.

But don't be dumb enough to believe in something that doesn't translate whatsoever to reality. Most people on here would already be atheists so there's no point preaching but just want to say that the world has far more to offer than religion will have you belief and this isn't some short trip in a grand journey. This *is* the grand journey. Do good without thinking of consequences and without shedding blood for any divine powers.

 If there are just gods then they would be pleased with you.

 If there are no gods then you have made the world a little better nonetheless. 

If your gods are displeased because you didn't worship and slaughter for them, then they are petty and cruel and not worthy of being called gods anyway. I can't explain how similar I feel with your thoughts Amen to that Yea exactly I think India should have a religion or no religion column 
Join r/atheismindia Wow i have always been a closeted agnostic. Didn't think there were many people in india with the same mindset. On seeing the reaction and comments here i am relieved. Hey look, an atheist on reddit! Up next, a bigot from BJP! So true
Take my fucking upvote. You only realized this now. Religion is the best tools for power mongers and you know it's another use, yeah you guessed it right, fool the foolish flock. That's the irony of religion   
Long long ago people settled in groups, made their own cultures, lifestyles and called it as religion to bring them closer.   
Now, the same religion is being used to make people apart!   
Sad part is, many can't see it. Religion is the opiate of the masses - Aristotle  maybe Religion is just some really good fiction with a very toxic fanbase I hear you. Also eloquently expressed by [Carl Sagan in The Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g) Finally the post I was waiting for..
Looks like people are starting to realize the true evil are the religion. I am getting out of these things lately. Religion at best are just fandoms and should not be given any importance in real life situations. Fuck all Humans, worst beings on earth! I have to say I like the singing and the dancing, from whatever religion, but for the rest I completely agree. Religion imo is nothing but a **MASS CONTROL**. People do not fucking respect religion, we are fucking scared from it. Human itself is the scourge of humanity. I have seen the good and bad things religions can do to people. So I see your point but not necessarily. Couldn't agree with you more! Im not that religious anyways, and you seem to have a good point. Religion is the main cause of unrest here, and if people don’t pay so much attention to it, the unrest might stop. Human...is above all religion...Lets practice humanity & co-exist in harmony & make the world  a better place I see, you are a man of ~~culture~~ intelligence as well.

Edit: I've had my share of  participation in atheist groups on the net. Sadly most of them are filled with people who don't know the difference between atheism and agnosticism. r/atheism Religion were made to bring people together in harmony, to share each other's thoughts, to help others out in need of help, but lately due to sheer greed of basic human nature. Religion has become a tool to control the masses and incite hate and violence against others who don't follow same ideology. nice post thanks for sharing George Carlin always had it right - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r-e2NDSTuE) Everyday I'm constantly reminded that 'prayers' are the single most useless invention of humankind. There is only one god : Time I see that you're a man of logic OP. Just joined, happy to see more people with common sense :3 The only thing religion does anymore is give us more artificial reasons to divide ourselves into tribes and hate each other. Couldn't agree more. Amen to that [Relevant Mr robot monologue](https://youtu.be/NCe8NUK4BjQ) Death to all fanatics! ""Hey if you read history, God is one of the leading causes of death, has been for thousands of years"" - George Carlin I hate it more than you all do. Lol. Cheers Fuck Atheism! How do you feel now? This is exactly how people with religious belief feel after reading this. [I am a athiest myself] Dude just the first 2 sentences were enough I'm Hindu. I chill with my gods and I am with you a 100%. It's not about being from a certain religion. It's about an individual's willingness to not take himself so fucking seriously, sit down, and contemplate his mad life. Who else have watched Man from the Earth.. Religion is how you can trick people into giving you their life.  Religion is the tool used to exploit the masses.  ""Don't worry, this life is just a test run.  Actually, the more you suffer in this life, the more god loves you- the more he can hook it up in the next life.""  Now give me tax free money, please.  Bonus points if you slay some infidel. I have pretty strong feelings about orgasm. Maybe thats what life is about - perpetual orgasm. Religion used to bring people together back in the ancient times to a common mindset so that they can be together, trust each other and work and discover & invent new things and develop various technologies. It used to unite people for greater things. But nowadays the amount of toxicity and hate spreading through religion is immense. Religion is dividing people than brigining them together.
Kinda ironic to its original purpose. What about Dudeism? Didn't know there's a sub for Indian atheists lol. I'm a fan of Indian atheists fb page. They call out all relegion equally, but ppl also get triggered when they oppose NRC and CAB, it amazes brahmin Bhakths don't understand they are standing up agsint discrimination not standing up for a relegion
.

Also why is that our mythology of gods only ever mention animals that exists today? Why isn't there a god with Dino as his vehicle? Coz they didn't dig deep enough to find one and ppl who made yo these back then didn't even know about pre historic animals. Think to yourself........... ""When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.""

Robert M. Pirsig I love u Yeah FUCK all religions. People dying over made-up stuff: Very Clever But what currently happening in India is Fascism using Religion masks to divide people.




Yup. The good ol' 'Divide and Conquer'. ""Doubt is the highest form of intelligence"" Religion should have no place in politics All religions are man-made and man is the effigy of mistakes. 

&#x200B;

Hit ^(Up-vote) if you agree the statement! Here here! Thank ""**GOD**"" someone stepped up and spoken the truth, the truth which matters the most in today's modern world.

You deserve every upvote on this post. As Geroge Carlin said the best and I quote - ""Idiots fighting trying to prove to eachother, whose imaginary friend has a bigger dick"". I’m not sure if atheism is the only way. It is a good way to focus on the grand scheme of things, but religion isn’t inherently wrong. I believe it changes are a result of technological advancement. While abandoning religion would work, ‘rebooting’ a religion could also work. I only say this because religions actually never invoke any violence. It’s the understanding of the people who practice it. Granted both are equally hard, but consider a religion such as the religious society of friends. They are a good example of how well religion can affect a society. If we educated people, and had them either further educate or cut ties with people who have immoral concepts, things would improve as well. Not shitting on your opinion. Just giving my two cents. I'll just give my 2 paise:

Religion is a meme. No, not in an Advice Animal kind of way, but if you go by the original meaning of a meme, it is an idea that compels people to propagate it. In this a meme behaves like an organism such as a virus. Thus, religion is a meme.

Another point to support this is that **religion does not exist without people**. Religion NEEDS people to survive, without people religion cannot exist. Therefore, people are more important than religion because people came first. Religion wholly exists in the minds of people, it is not a tangible thing.

1 paisa more: Religion does not only mean belief in some god, IMO even Nationalism and Patriotism can be religions in their own right. Although I agree, heres a clip of [Joe Rogan talking to Physicist Brian Greene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpStPNAB7Cw) on the actual purpose of Religion. Very interesting take and I agree with him too. But most people take their religions very literally. Would you like to join the church of shrek? ""In this world, good people will do good things and bad people will do bad things, but for a good man to do bad things, it takes religion."" I became an athiest due to a few reason but mainly because of eiliot's talk on religion which stuck with me for years, I introspected on it never found a contradiction so I quit believing in my religion. There are a lot more reasons but still.



One of the lines he said was

""Religion is nothing but a poorly written sci-fi franchise that we are huge fan boys of""


""Why are wars fought in his name if peace is what he desires""


The best one

""God is a drug and we are the addicts."" Amen I read a book by Jack Donovan, The Way of Men.

In the book he said that it's man's primal desire to belong to a group, to be a part of something greater than himself.

The teens, and young adults that you see rioting on the streets are fulfilling their desire to belong to something, to fight for something, to stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow men. Everything else is a superficial excuse to act on that instinct.

When you have a large population of uneducated people devoid of critical thinking abilities, they are pretty much zombies acting on instinct and very shallow reasoning, which is evident when you hear those arsonists talk. These people are the pawns, unknowning and unpaid mercenaries of anyone smart enough to rally them. The universe is 13.7 billion years old, the earth only 4.4 billion. What was god doing during those 9 billion years. Also, when we finally get to Mars and other star systems maybe in the future, how will we get to heaven? Where is heaven? Can we go faster than the speed of light going from the other star system to go back to earth and go into heaven of hell? God is fake and made up, evolution is real  and we will all die. Eventually our planet will be unbearable for human life as we know it. Amen to this PREACH!! Op: Babe, can we smash?
OP’s gf: No, I’m waiting til marriage
Op: “Fuck all religion. It’s bullshit” You have successfully summarised the trimmings of your education, and preserved this moment in time. I’m excited for you, not many people get to develop further and then be able to point back to the moment they were so very wrong. I appreciate the effort though, as I used to believe what you have written, so it’s a clear view onto my past self. Well articulated! If I may throw you a crumb of comfort, life would be boring if we had all the answers, so in the future when you read these words again, you may wonder, as I do now, the vast learning opportunities that remain. Is this by any chance in context to the current political situation in India.

Because if it is then it would seem like a very irresponsible thing to project onto social media. Like an ""all lives matter"" kind of argument.

e.g. Saying the same thing in a country where atheists are being prosecuted or where people stigmatized atheists is a noble and brave thing but saying the same thing in China would mean siding with thier current regimes inhumane persecution and rounding of of Muslims in concentration camps)
Not to mention feeding into thier weird obsession with Tibet and who the next Dalai lama should be.

Imagine a Pakistani saying fuck Hinduism and fuck Islam while a hindu village is burned by mullah led mobs. Blaming the oppressor doesn't have to mean you blame the victim as well, and as much as you probably don't mean it that way, in the current context it **seems** a lot like that.

PS: if you're going to bring in the fact that it's not just Hindus attacking Muslims but the opposite as well, I'd want to invite you to remember it's starts in the broader context of the CAA-NRC under which it's fairly obvious who's going to be suffering. r/atheism So I have to ask what's happening in India that got this guy so riled up against religion? Glad that you've out grown religion 👍 This post is GOLD! I totally agree with you All religions are fantasy like Harry Potter but let’s be honest, not all religions are the same, some are worse than others when it comes to coexisting.  
Some Christians and Muslims believe every word in their fantasy book and are influenced by it to hate those who aren’t like them or are homosexuals. Have you ever tried to read and interpret what's written in any religious text like the Gita? AMEN BROTHER Yes, complete agreement.  I call this anti-theism, not atheism. Religion is a tool people use to deal with living it isn’t just about death. Unfortunately we’re not pure logical being. A lot of people with emotions will turn to higher powers in any form. Sadly this message will never reach to the people who need to see this. Among them most will simply reject it. ""Religion is the husk of faith"" -Tao Te Ching Lets all realize that the universe doesn't care because it cannot.  Take action based on our species and this shared planet to protect ourselves by cherishing all life around us.  Resist the animal nature or mammalian ways.  Do not overpopulate the planet assuming only humans are important.  Do not pollute and exploit based solely on your very short life span but instead think of long term life.  We are evolution and each choice brings about rewards or failures for our species.  Lets choose to share with all life and allow room because from what we can observe there is no global, universe consciousness that cares. The amount of scientific evidence for religion and flat earth theory is exactly the same. As a society, we just accept the former because it's been around for so long and is ""tradition"". You forgot 30000-15000 years ago we became best freinds with wolves and they have had our backs since . They have shed more blood for us than you could imagine. Fighting off animals to protect our children and crops and domestic animals. I hate how people thank god when it was dog by our side fighting and dying with us. Damn, you went rough. Before religion there were tribes and races. People always loved to form groups for recognition and unity.Thats just the nature of us humans, removing religion will not stop violence although admitting it is very easy weapon, something else will take its place. What needs to be removed is hate and instate understanding our differences and accepting each other. Religion is to humans is what Modi is to India! I agree lol Too bad Modi doesnt feel the same way. Tbh religion fills in the gaps that makes other feel unimportant as they do not matter to the universe. You can follow a religion and my opinion of you wouldn't go any lower and rather than having emotions that make you feel unimportant it can be good at times. tl;dr

Religion is outdated. But. It fills an important role.

Why are we here? What's next? Why did this bad thing happen to me? Look at all these people, they compete for my education, my job, my housing, my future wife... they are my enemies! Why should I not harm others?

There are a bunch of questions that are very hard to answer without some fundamental truth - or lacking that, something that you accept as fundamentally true. kendrick lamar once said: ""fuck your ethnicity""

thanks

also today is ash wednesday They like to say that religion brought people together. No. It united certain groups of people to become stronger than other groups of people so that they might kill and decimate them. Fuck all Religion. Yes - otherwise religion will fuck us all! Can I have an Amen...!!! Someone get this guy some Jesus in his life ASAP! Well that’s certainly one opinion Look into the church of the flying spaghetti monster.  This is the only understandable religion imo. It ain’t that bad.

I guess it’s because religion has never been a negative thing in my life, and I’ve been lucky to be born into a country that allows me to practice what I want, in a community that is forgiving, and for a family that doesn’t judge.

I literally do not care what my neighbors believe or don’t believe. I agree Thank you, you are better than every god bothering nobody I am glad they burnt petrol pump, at least someone is unhappy because of hiked fuel prices :D Please talk about economy at this stage man please, people were saying the growth rate has been negative but since the 2020 has started I have heard or read no news on how the economy is going. I 100% agree, well said Religion is Politics. Something you use to keep society under control. But I wouldn't use the f word here. Some people are good enough to do things on their own but plenty others need guidance.
And once again a rookie mistake of connecting Deity with Religion. 
The one who follows religion is the one who follows the rules of society. But the one who seeks God is the one who renounces all possesion and abandons the social life. I like this one It is superstition, like ghosts or bigfoot I really really wish Ravi Zacharias could respond to some these comments. It would be hilarious and sad at the same time... I didn't know I had a twin in India. Wishing you a great life friend. Too Right 👏 I completely agree, especially with all the shit going on in Delhi rn Yup, finally someone said it. 👍🏻 Finally someone who gets it and is talkong sense. Religions are one of the biggest cancers of the world right now. And if you really believe the bullshit they tell, i dont know what to tell you... Life isnt a fairytale Now this is a good post! Religion is like spoiled milk. Hey fuck you buddy 👉🏻

MODI GANGGG 🇮🇳 Hoes mad Time to sort by controversial Life was a party till religion came along..

Humans still understood right from wrong because they have emotions... understanding right from wrong is all that matters... If only people have the will and the mind to believe what they actually believed all these years is utter bullshit. I can only imagine a better world without religion. More morale, more discipline, and a whole lot of love. Thank you OP, you are correct. Very well written and I wish you the best.

There are some wonderful Bollywood anti-religious movies available. These three movies are quite funny and a few of my favorites. 

[Dharam Sankat Mein ('Religion in Trouble')](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4354740/?) - *At the age of 55, a Hindu man discovers that he was born Muslim and adopted by a Hindu family.*  It has a score of 6.3 on IMDB; 

[PK](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2338151/?) - *An alien lands on earth and acts so crazy they ask if he's 'PK' which means 'tipsy' or 'drunk.'* It has a score of 8.1 on IMDB; and 

[OMG: Oh My God](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283748/?) - *An atheist files at lawsuit against God.*. It  has a score of 8.2 on IMDB.

[Here's a list of 7 movies that reflect the dark side of religion.](https://in.bookmyshow.com/entertainment/movies/hindi/bollywood-movies-on-religion/) Those three are on that list, as well as several that look serious.  I just posted asking why religion is a sensitive topic and everyone downvoted and this has 2.9k likes xD Yo what pissed you off to this extent man? If it brings people happiness.and peace of mind.  It’s wonderful.  And it’s fun to think about what came first the chicken or the egg. Who is reading this in 2020? You're a good person for this, OP. I respect your opinion I see that title, I upvote. Isn't it ironic that almost all atheist have a God complex ? Finnaly something I can read...lmao Here from /r/all and I just wanted to say, **hell yes India!**  Your country seems amazing in many ways, but also so damn backwards... TIL that ""atheist"" or ""none"" is not even an option for official religions/beliefs in your country.  When you look at the trends for how humanity is progressing, almost every advance is met by a decline in religion.  
Get that shit outta there!  
And this, from a 'spiritual' person, Buddhist/Atheist, functionally agnostic, and Canadian, for context if it matters.  
May you all be well and happy, may you all be at peace. Congratulations, you've just explained the core of Buddhism!  I'm only partly joking. Buddhism's main tenents are non-theistic and are about abandoning attachment in order to live fully in the moment and see the world clearly.  But I get your point. Man I wish more people could read this. The whole country needs to read this! a wise man once said Religion is the opium of the masses.. any guess who? but in india that ideology is also made a villain by constant propaganda. if anyone can kick sanghi asses its them. The early people realizes the best. What makes me angry the most is that it is killing the scientific temper in our ppl! Preach. Heh.

  


Seriously though. Yes. Fuck'em all. Take it back, Flying Spaghetti Monster is REAL Of course everyone is confused. The universe is infinitely complicated. We shouldn't look down on them for their ignorance. I don't think all religions are bad but I don't think any of them are 100% correct. I do believe there is something after we die. You can't create or destroy anything in this reality. It only changes form. This. Fuck yeah, man. You nailed it; fuck religion!"

Agreed that BJP is flawed and not perfect (no party is), but why does r/india always resort to Modi Party bashing? 
To the best of my knowledge, I've not come across any post appreciating steps or courses taken by the government towards people's welfare.
Incessant dissent towards everything done by the Govt only lowers reliability of the accuser. I don't know why we are painting BJP as dumb people here. Religion and faith provide good fallbacks when science and technology fail.

It's very normal for people to turn to god's when perhaps science and technology seen incapable. It's a very common human feeling to seek comfort in belief in God or technology and when we feel abandoned by one we naturally gravitate towards the other.

I don't see why this very human stance taken by these people needs to be put up as a BJP stupid meme."

Maybe we can elect a cow instead of Modi for next term. Buffalos are a new minority now. Smh Fucked up part is that many would agree that this is true.

His desi gai stayed though What's the criteria for being declared honest? Shouldn't it be said as racist... Poor buffalo's being discrimated ...  As I veterinary student, it is my experience that the opposite is true in almost all the points. Exotic breeds have a friendlier temperament than indigenous ones, while also having higher production and better feed conversion efficiency. Local breeds are much more aggressive and a nightmare to treat.
And Buffalo milk is much better suited for making products like ice cream, butter, etc due to more fat percentage while buffaloes themselves are more disease resistant in general, and cleaner as they have almost no hair and love bathing in water.
Also, there is no 'surya ketu' nerve. Well none that I've ever read about in any anatomy textbook. M.Tech. Gau Rakshak Last 3 points for buffaloes are sketches of Bollywood villains.

All of these points sound like bullshit. Zero marks... Yeh sale jaanwaro main bhi discriminate karte hain yes right Indian Cow and buffalo having sense of honesty, as they always reach to their Owners home at night after whole day spend on Road by disturbing traffic.  Only if Mr. Buffalo could lawyer up and sue Ms Cow for defamation and slander. I have seen cows crusted in shit eating shit sticking around each other's bum. Cow ""will not stand or sit around dirty place"" indeed. It's like these people refuse to see what's happening right in front of their eyes. Or if they see it, just say cowdung is clean, and there you are. Wait, has UNESCO already approved this? How does indian beef taste compared to the US ? What the hell is Active sense?? If it's on an archived website can we conclude it was removed was lack of its worthiness. The guy who wrote it is very biased 
As if buffalo stole his money Very dump

Wow Voice like screams So by that definition the article was written by a Buffalo mera cow mahan  That's it. Cow for PM 2019. Yeah, I prefer my cows with a lot of ""acknowledgement sense"". Thank you very much. Sri-Sri as in Art of Living? Even the cow and buffalo is dragged into the race/culture/religion debate and propaganda. India 2022,i guess.

That's called science, research and technology Its the breed that is different, nothing else. Thanks for the nice information on the difference between Indian cow and buffalo .It will be very helpful if you share it in some more detailed way. I feel that[ Indian organic milk](http://www.annammilk.com/) is highly advisable. Didn’t find anything like this on website  It is not the truth. Somebody is making the joke. Uhm if you ask any Indian farmer he’ll agree with them also I think you should stay away from your half assed knowledge unless you yourself have experience in farming "

FUCK YOU FIITJEE. It's a shame that we don't have laws governing who gets to use terms like ""University"" or ""academy"". >FIITJEE

Fuck IITJEE
 FIITJEE is the most fucked up institute. Their math books start with equations. Like wtf. They know how to make simple things tough. They produce top rankers only because of large enrollment numbers and a handful of south Delhi teachers. I remember last time they referred 'Ram Rajya'.
Edit: I forgot about their mentions in Paradise papers. And yes these Institute do not teach science. Science is not sitting in a room and solving questions for two long year. Krishna killed a bunch of people after lyying to them. I doubt he gives a fuck about shit like poaching faculty. नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।

उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ।। Salem Hypothesis - People who believe in God(creationism) and are men of science are likely to be engineers than Scientists.
 If I hate this ad... Will I go to hell ?  +1 on fiitjee is cancer. Studied there full time for 2 years only to realize that my time and self confidence was wasted Meh, its advertising. End of the day they will still teach science only Its a private company, it can do what it wants, right? People can just choose not to go there. The ad is deplorable. But Fiitjee is way better than narayana and chaitanya. Atleast where I studied. We live in a 1.3 billion society where 50% of the population is under 25. Blame the competition and lack of resources to educate the students. Peer pressure just adds depression into this primordial soup. 

When I studied in fiitjee (did not clear iitjee but got into a well known college) . There were no extra classes and we were taught Just the subject and given phase books. (8 phases in 2 years). You get into a good college if by yourself are motivated to study harder. Peer pressure kept us on our toes. Their material is good. More importantly, I learned to practice self-discipline. Something that was very useful when I entered college. I saw so many burned out people in IIT tanking their GPA from other  pre-university institutes.  Dude every iit jee Institute is like that all are fuckin pricks and sometimes even teachers are racists  Kalyug isn't an *idea*, it's a cosmological time-frame described in the Vedic literatures.

Science/Technology,One of the good effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot.,53,friwew,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/friwew/one_of_the_good_effects_of_lockdown_is_that_air/,31,1585565539.0,"One of the positive effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot and pollution is going down.

It should be noted that worldwide more people die due to air pollution than what the covid19 has claimed till date.

While we have been very serious about tackling the virus threat we have literally done nothing to tackle the air pollution threat which claims more lives.

Let us all support reduction of pollution be it air,water or soil.

Edit : I am using technology to put my thoughts out to everyone. I am not anti science or anti technology nor development, rather my point is currently whatever we are doing has been causing more harm than good. So let us strive to make more informed choices in future be more wise , make sure we try to change tracks for cleaner technology.

Maybe consume less, support clean tech., work to clean out rivers and lakes, plant more trees and not cut them ,use less plastic ... there can be many small things we can start with and go forward.",manofsteel911," Humans are the cancer Dude yes. I've been hoarding air on the rooftop. Bc le lo jabhtak hai. Once life resumes it'll be shit again. I start panicking when I read the damage done to children's lungs just by living in Delhi and I have to distract myself from thinking that because it's frankly depressing I'm pretty sure in the long run pollution would have caused more death than the virus. God knows how many cancers have been caused because of us not respecting the environment. Maybe the world can initiate a movement to hold a weeklong (or two) lockdowns annually so as to give nature a breather.   
We can also use this time for meditation and reflect on our lives. Operation success. Patient dead definitely Wait for Corona virus to end , They are saying production will go at 200% speed with no working holidays and that may lead to even more unsustainable pollution every day .

In your first year, you are not allowed to have laptops. Also very minimal interaction with seniors. 

Also I have heard that you get a scholarship for your tuition throughout but have to maintain a certain GPA, else you'll have to pay them the fees. And if you maintain the GPA, and ISRO is looking for engineers, you will have to join them unless you buy them out by paying the whole course fee.

Also you get nice weed in the Trivandrum campus. At your age I would just go ogle them things. what would you like to know?"
Science/Technology,"Scientists of India, ministry of science and technology wants you for research on Yoga & meditation",93,70mzlx,https://imgur.com/NF5ee1Y,23,1505676889.0,,pakaomat," [deleted] Though myself vehemently oppose the zabardasti ka superior kulcha line. I have no issues with proper scientific research done to prove the benefits or ills of said kulcha.  The only problem I see is that the research will be done in a shoddy manner and hence be a waste of money. This is actually much needed. There are so many neuroscience studies on the effect of drugs, videogames, sex, tv, facebook etc on our brains - but different forms of meditation are not as studied. Each one would yield different results. It's time these were scientifically scrutinized.

 The only question is whether unsatisfactory results will be allowed to be published. > SATYAM

This government sure knows how to spin creative acronyms. Very welcoming! We should do more research on this rather than Harvard or Stanford.
There is a lot of research that these two institutions do inspite of yoga being an Indian thing. We should try to match them. Where's the problem OP? There are already many international universities researching the benefits of meditation on the brain. Why shouldn't India do it? Don't expect me to spit on something just because it's connected to religion and you have problems with it. *Disclaimer: If the paper shows yoga and meditation have no major impact on health The Truth Ministry will make sure the researcher get Vyapamed™. Please read the terms and conditions carefully before applying. BMJK. OP you are a scumbag. This project might actually help in getting rid of dumb pseudoscience and superstition associated with yoga and ayurveda. Stop dissing on Indian culture and arts just cos they dont fit your worldview, you goddamn pseudo-secular self-hating commie fake-liberal fake-scientific thinker. I dont mind the request from the ministry , what i worried here is how much of these research are going to be genuine , as there is more chance , few of the research later on can be used by this govt to support yoga and meditation being implemented ...like say while watching a movie in a theatre... Soon Research Proposals for Cow Dung and Gau mutra  Whatever Yoga & Meditation might be, they are definitely NOT science and technology.

Science/Technology,[Serious Post] Bye,378,f161mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f161mw/serious_post_bye/,124,1581266387.0,"It's about time for me. I don't see the relevance of trying to go through the drudgery again and again. I beg for some patience on your part to go through this post.

At 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.

I am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.

&#x200B;

I was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.

&#x200B;

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye.",Snoopyrun," You seriously need counseling. These thoughts are no jokes. 

What really blows my mind is how our lives are similar yet different. 

I didn't get any decent job for about 2 years after I finished my B.Tech. When I got one after a year or so my company decided to close the unit and everyone lost their jobs. 

Then I started to teach few students and decided to try for government job. Even cleared all the exams but failed to get into final selection list. 

Then I joined another company and there I got into an accident. 

I severely damaged my arm and doctors told me to avoid heavy work for at least 2 years later. I took few steps back and started to teach in a college as a part time assistant lecturer. 

Even after all the bad luck I never felt hopeless. 

I am still in search for a decent job but I always try to be optimistic. 

I recommend you to get professional help before hurting yourself. You sir, are not a failure. You have managed to persevere till this day even with the constant downs in your life. Better things await you in your life from here on. 

Try getting a professional help as I have heard many people here saying that it really helps. And lastly don't lose hope. Please dm. We can talk. I can totally relate to the post. Don't take this step and take some counselling ASAP. You should try giving highschool students English tuitions. People from small towns will pay good money. Your writing skills are really good. You don't even need a degree to open private tuitions. He is not responding to any of the posts here.....I hope he is alright :( There's millions of others who share your story my friend. Even worse situation than you. Also think about those illiterates ones as well. You know what those illiterates would say to you "" Atleast you are educated, one day or the other you will find a job, whatever it will be, but for us there is nothing else."" 

I'm not stopping you to feel frustrated. But it has no solutions. Saying goodbye here won't change your life soon. It will always be a struggle and even if you find a job, the struggles won't end there. You will be forced to drop all your morality and education into the gutter when situation arises you to do things against your policy and wishes. Cuz then you would call it survival for the fittest.

What you feel right now won't be the same in the future. You have to understand this is real life. You will face this situation when you feel completely lost and in vain. Happens to the best of us and even to the worst. 

Without giving my old cridentials, I'll tell you I used to Manage a floor of 300 employees worldwide. Now for the past decade I work at a local wineshop as a manager. My team consists of uneducated asswipes who steal and behave as if they are hardworking fellas. They think I'm a fool, when I know every angle of their stealing from the shop. But I stay silent and cover their ass cuz they really are hardworking fellas. So do I feel sad that how my life changed, yes. But is it worth it, definitely not. I realized my circumstances and did whatever I could find to survive. Sucking up my standards and ego. If you can do that, you are a winner. 

All the doors aren't shut like you said. Because even I thought all the doors was shut 10 years ago, when I was at ICU battling for my life for 3 days. After 20 days in the hospital, I got discharged with an heavy bill and payments to others. Almost lost my home and family back then. Suicide was the only solution for me. Because my ego didn't allow me to accept failure. Now, I'm here replying to you like a future. Think about it man, 10 years ago, I was you. And I wasn't lucky, it was worse even after backing out of suicide. Nothing changed, I was still the same frustrated man. But there's something called as TIME. it changes things man. It really does. For every living beings. It's the law of the nature. 

You can be anything, only if you want it to be. It is the only truth. Dude, firstly stop whatever you are planning to do.

Just read this thread, one of these suggestions might work for you.

Secondly, don't relate your worth with how much you wealth you have, or even how many friends you have. Remember, at the end of the day, we have to save ourselves. 

So please take care of yourself. Start doing things you like.

Don't like anything? Think about yourself as a child, what were your dreams? What did you like to do? Do that. Watch the clouds, breathe the air, go to any park, sit there. Look at nature, feel that you are alive. 

Listen to your heartbeat. Put a mirror in front of you and cry your heart out. And keep looking at yourself, tell yourself ""it's okay to cry, it's okay to feel down, but this is not the end of me.""

Call your parents, talk to them. Ask about their day, just listen to the sweetness in their voice.

Eat whatever you like. Think of all the good food that you like, go buy some fruits you like, eat that.

Get a new haircut, dress yourself nicely. Go for runs in the morning, exercise or play a sport.

The idea is to keep your body moving, do things that you like, take care of your mental health and tell yourself ""it's okay, it's okay to feel down""  this too shall pass. [And it's not your fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQht2yOX9Js). 

Take control of your life! Live! “Man’s search for meaning” by Viktor Frankl - PLEASE read this book. It might give you some encouraging perspectives on life. Please don’t take any impulsive decision. You are strong!! Hi, PM me. 


My fiancé said he will find you get a job in his company, if that’s the issue. We could help you out financially if that’s an issue as well. Whatever you need, we’ll help you. I’ve already lost a brother to suicide, I will absolutely not let you do this. 

PM ME.   We’re here to talk to you. 


Don’t be dumb. Don’t do this. 


Reach out. I’m here for you. Buddy, you should hone your skills in some other field when you have the free time, even if it doesn't reap any financial benefits. Reading this post, I feel that you should give writing a shot. Just because you do not have the skills to do well in one isolated field does not mean you are useless. It is a very childish reason to feel any sort of guilt. Hope you see things the way they really are. Have a good day. [deleted] This is the state of mind of all non successful IT guys, trust me I have seen few of my useless colleagues getting 2x package jump in new companies and I am still at the same company , it feels bad to see non talented people getting good jobs, but life is that way , just be happy with whatever job you have , just don't compare yourself with the guys getting better pay, compare with those who don't have job at all Hey man. Life is a long marathon. You haven't even completed the first set of laps. It sounds like you have a job but you're not motivated at it but you don't want to quit just yet and try a career change. That's fair. Why don't you throw yourself into learning something relevant to your career? Go back to the basics and re-learn things again. You'll be impressed by how much you've learnt that you've put into practice. There are lots of free courses out there.

It also sounds like you are having a difficult time at work. We don't talk about our emotions often in India. Why don't you ask your team lead out for lunch on a weekend or something? Say you have something important to tell them and ask them to meet you outside work. Be honest and tell them about your challenges and your hopes and ask them if they can help you in any way. You would be surprised at how people react to honesty. Frankly, it might make the person relieved because it's much easier working with an existing employee instead of finding a new one and training them from scratch.

The other thing that seems to bother you is the fact that you seem to be the breadwinner. If that's the case then why don't you have a discussion with your Dad and figure out how much the family needs monthly so that you don't stress yourself out by thinking you need a much larger sum than what you actually need?

All in all, it sounds like you're aware of your problems. That's a good sign. Never underestimate the power of self-belief. You just have to do better today than yesterday. Friends are not disappointed in you and they don't want to avoid you. They're just waiting for you to reach out. Hey, yes you! Listen to me dawg there’s nothing in this world that’s not achievable and I mean every word of that sentence. I think it’s right to tell you that I know how you’re feeling and what you’re going through as I was in the similar situation just like this where though of taking my own life also struck my mind. Everyone around me thought that I was an abomination but little as they knew, they’re the same people telling me what a change I made in my life towards a better future. I know what it feels to have no friends or family to talk to. I was an introvert too so making new friends seemed far too unlikely.

Let me tell you few changes you need to start making in your lifestyle starting now to achieve the set goal. And remember these are just baby steps which will make you feel good about yourself and think positive.
1. Always go to bed before midnight and sleep at least 7-8 hours every single day.
2. Wake up, jog for half an hour, get back take a bath and have breakfast.
3. Go to work thinking what an amazing day it is and do listen to few melodies on the way.
4. Start from basics and learn your way upwards. Never think what your companions might say or do.
5. On your way home from work stop at some local market and get some fruits/vegetables for you and your family.
6. [MUST] Visit nearby temple of whatever religion you believe in and spend an evening there daily.
7. Meet new people, have a little chat about how their day was and tell them about you.
8. Get home spend time with your family, have a dinner together if you could, watch some TV.
9. Attend social gathering as much as you can.
10. Never be alone, be with someone always.
11. Don’t drink/smoke/drugs. Never become addicted to something. Try once or twice but don’t let it consume you.
12. Stop binge watching TVs and movies, I used to do that a lot and it just ends up wasting much time, Haha.
13. Last but not the least, never stay at home in your spare time. Go out wherever you want. Just be outside. Do whatever you want. It helps to cultivate your mind for new possibilities and improvise.

God Bless you! You have an amazing life ahead of you waiting for you to just explored.

P.S. If you ever need to talk to someone about anything don’t ever hesitate to message/DM me.  Before you take any steps, please teach out to a counsellor. Just as a last effort. I can understand the stagnation you must feel, but know this a lot of people are in the same boat, including me. I am 36 and as lost as I can be. I dont want to pursue my earlier career path and have been unemployed for depressing long. No idea what I want to do anymore. I know the feeling when at night you think that you were simply not to wake the next day, it would be no loss to anyone, including yourself. Please, please reach out to a counsellor. Man if you change your decision (I think you should) try to understand not everyone is going to win the race somehow my parents taught me this very well and I have learnt to be content of what I have even before I started graduation.
You are just looking for happiness in wrong places.
Quit everything go and talk to old monks and use your physical health to help in whatever way you can.
What is stopping you? You might stay poor for the rest of your life but you will be a 'Brave poor' ending your life is only gonna bring more misery to your name and your parents.

If you really care about them do something with your life.Literally anything trust me deep down all parents just want their children to be a good human being over being rich.

Trust me if you are not doesn't mean you are a coward.I agree some people are born intelligent but that doesn't make you a coward.You have to develop the will to fight by yourself.

And I ll say it again not everyone is destined for being rich and all.If you're not succeeding in your life then you are just going on a path which is not yours. Try and be optimistic my friend. Start changing one thing at a time. Damn. I felt that hard. I'm doing medschool and I thought depression was not that big. How utterly wrong I was. 

As suggested by many about counselling. Go for it. What you'll get are anti-depressants and good sound advice. That'll make you better.

As for finance, now that you won't be listless enough (anti-depressants and mood stabilisers kick in in about a month) you can start developing new interest in your work.

Once you are out of it, as a 30 y/o, you'll have a lot of experience. Use it to start loving your job. Or finding new one later on. 

Don't be too hard on yourself. You are educated. You'll do fine. Hi, I'm really sorry you're going through all of this. Please please please consider going for counselling/therapy. These are signs of depression. And it's no joke. You're not being pathetic at all. As someone who was once in depression, I partly understand how you might be feeling. But therapy really really helped me.

Please consider going for therapy. DM me if you want to talk. Take care. Just saying these same things to a psychiatrist could help immensely. Right now, the thoughts have overcrowded and want to be let out
Always remember these words ""nothing is permanent but change""
 
Believe me, if your head is clear,  the solutions will follow. Maybe you've neglected your wellbeing until now. That needn't be the case henceforth.
Life is learning. And the initial stages are difficult but essential for growth. If you just seek for help, youd be surprised how others are willing to help you. You dont need the whole world to care for you to get out of your rut, you just need a few good ones. 

Please seek help for the sake of youself and for the sake of your near and dear ones. A good you, mentally,  emotionally is all they ask of you.
Economic situation will follow. 

Learn to cultivate a positive mindset.
Get a hobby, pastime and spend time on them regularly. And now, you owe it to redditors here too to take care of yourself

Its never too late. Dear OP, the company you mentioned do provide some sort of help for people with depression and such thoughts. Even though that company is not the best, this is a really good initiative. Do reach out of those people in your office, talk to them. Help is within your reach sir. And having worked in same company, i have seen people with far less communication and writing skills than you being in top positions. Dont lose heart Mate you need counseling and help with mental illness. Please stop, suicide is not a solution, and I know life feels hopeless.

Do you have anyone to talk to? If not then pm me and we can talk.

The first step here is to seek professional counselling. Dm man if you need help. You have some work experience. You were just in a shitty situation. Any choice will be better than suicide. So it's better to talk The biggest privilege is we are alive and have access to unlimited information. Taking breaks is very important life. We think our life bound to our employment and we judge ourselves invariably. The truth is we are all not good at everything that we do,  its supposed to be that way but we are certainly good at something. We need to find what we like. Live our life for ourselves first and nobody else. That is when we will discover what we mean we are much more than the cubicle that we slouch in. Life is much more than a soulless job. Been depressed for about 3 years, On meds and improving. I don't have any elaborate words to teach you about life,but just wanted to say one thing. What your mind is suggesting currently is just a way to get out of all the mess, there are thousand others and maybe better ways. Hang on, it will pass. Hey at least your vocabulary is good. You'll be good at litrature try writing sometime. Nihilist Indian here as well. My mind boggles at the fact that a sizeable population of our country continues to dredge on with their meaningless life.

I have seen the people in IT, they're not useful for anything apart from projecting a really bad image of Indian IT. Many of them don't have the aptitude for it, so it's not their fault, I just feel something like the army, or B. Com. followed by the thousands of niche careers (I know a person who's into SCM, and pretty good at it, I can also imagine how shit she would be at something like coding). People mindlessly going into, medical, engineering, MBA and the institutes encouraging them to screw up their entire life for profit.

Alcohol and weed numb the pain only temporarily, my mind then again starts asking if the purpose of my life is to build something for a firangi, who can then sell it to another firangi, to get this coupons that I can exchange for a lifestyle that tries to emulate the firangis, but a low quality version of it?

I then try to convince myself that there's some redemption in living for my family, but in the end the only thing I'm achieving is the continuation of this mindless drudgery. Hey bro...dont do this...please reply...there is 288k people reading your story and worried about you...we can talk and make ur life better... believe me we can..just reply Sounds a lot like me except I have only a handful of months of work experience but that particular part doesn't bother me as I have zero interests or goals let alone the desire to build a career.

I hope you stumble upon something joyful to live for before it's too late. Am. In a government job.... Less pay and long working hours.... But i have developed hobbies and all... I read a lot and play basketball everyday... So make new passions if this one doesn't serve you well... Easy to say and all but don't give up.... This will all. One day be a learning for you... Dont give up at all.... This is the best advice I was ever given, so I will pass it on to you:

Which college to attend, whether to buy a car, should you get married or not...for any big decision in life, you should wait at least three days.

What you seem to be considering is an irreversible decision. There is no going back. Since this is a very big decision in your life, which will also affect all the friends, family and loved ones in your life, you should take at least three days to consider it.

I am not giving this advice lightly. I have been in your shoes many times, and this is the advice I take. I know you feel extremely low right now, but that feeling is not permanent. After three days, I assure you this feeling will pass. But you cannot be rash. 

I also want to explain to you that there is such as thing as brain chemistry. For people like us, certain neurotransmitters may be low. This is not anyone's fault, it is how we are. I strongly advise you to see a psychologist, and also consider seeing a psychiatrist. When you have a stomach ache, you take medicine to heal your stomach. When there is a chemical imbalance in the brain, taking medicine can drastically improve your life.

I am not a doctor, so please, go see a psychiatrist (these are people who are therapists but also have medical degrees, they are literally brain doctors) and they will help you deal with this.

You are not alone, and if you need to talk to someone feel free to DM me. Dude, I empathize with you since my life has been eerily similar to yours. I just wanted you to know that you write really well and that's something I wished I was good at. Try to use that skill. 

PM me if you would like to talk about anything. Please talk to us. Please. 

We are all here for you and we all care. If you want to vent and you want someone to listen, PM me. I won't offer advice or sympathy, but I'll listen attentively and empathetically. If you don't want that, tell me how you want us to talk and we'll do things your way, at your pace.

I would urge you to seek counselling. It isn't for the weak and the stigma around it is false. As someone who has talked to a lot of people with problems, therapy can and does help.

There is always hope. Promising that things will get better seems disingenuous, because the future is unknown. But, hope remains a constant. And, one more thing remains constant: there are always people who care. You will never trade your place in those people's hearts because your place is permanent and you are irreplaceable to them. Nothing changes that.

Please PM any one of us, myself included. Lay your expectations out and we'll be there for you in the capacity you think you want.

Edit: If anyone reading this feels like you don't have a friend you can call at 2AM, I am ex-London Nightline volunteer and am trained in handling suicide/self-harm calls, along with the heaviest of topics. Don't worry about bogging me down. PM me and I will talk. I will try to ensure that your messages reach me. Alternatively, please go to Nightline.org.uk and use their free IM service. Hey there,

if you want to talk to someone, you can PM. we can talk it over the phone. 

I can guarantee you , you are looking at this the wrong way.

Give me chance to change your mind. 

You got nothing to lose and everything to gain if you just talk to me. Think about parents. Dont leave them alone. Atleast try to live for them. First things first -- SEEK HELP. The kind of thoughts you are describing perfectly fit the clinical definition of depression. I'm sorry that you are going through this, man.

Secondly, look for opportunities that you can do to keep going for now. Since you're on reddit, I suggest looking into /r/slavelabour and other subs. The flow of money will keep you occupied and give you some financial stability and allow you to access more resources.

Lastly, connect with people who are/were in a similar situation and made it out. Hope this helps, good luck to you. Please reach out for some counselling, please think positive, lime many have suggested, you have skills you might not even realize are of great value to many. Like you English composition is way above average and something that you can tap into. Some people might say that you have nothing to loose at this juncture then why not take a risk and do something on the business /freelancing front and see how it goes. Have a positive attitude, don't worry about the world, never think people are out to judge you for what you are in life. Being a ""failure"" (your word) doesn't mean you have to give up, the whole world is out there, go do what makes you happy. You just need a good therapist bro. There are better replies here than mine, so i just hope you find peace man. Bye. OP, you need to stop doing this. Go get some basic checks done. Like thyroid etc. Sit down, make a plan, pop a modafinil every few days and go to work like a madman. You'll be better. Maybe you are not meant for computer jobs..is there anything nelse you are passionate about Try to accept pain.It may not make sense but if you’re able to channel your pain you wouldn’t go through like this.Try to think less and work more.The world is an insanely unfair place and I’m sorry that you had such a difficult life.Just do it for your parents maybe but ending it now will not account for the pain you’ve already faced.People will torture your parents and you’ll be branded useless for the remainder of your remembrance...Just for your parents go through this everyone dies at some point naturally or otherwise.Don’t do it because the moment you’re in the middle of dying you’ll regret it but you’ll not be able to undo it. If you look at the grand scheme of things, the universe doesn't really care about who has achieved how much, and who hasn't. We are all just a speck of dust in the cosmos, a blip in the timeline of the universe. So comparing ourself with other so called ""successful"" people is useless.

On the other hand, there are people in this world who are worse off than you. You at least have a job man... You were once smart, intelligent. 100/100 doesn't just happen.

I have felt the same way in life, and I know it's a shitty feeling. But that is no reason for just giving up. Once you reach rock bottom, the only direction left for you is up.

Think about it this way: Do you really want to be the reason of your parents' sadness? Or do you want to start again, and fight your way through?

Don't go by the norms of the society - So what if society thinks everyone should have a decent job? Fuck that! Make your own way, make your on goals.

Career is just one small part of your life. I don't know why everyone is so fixated on just making money. Find something that truly brings happiness.

Don't be so judgemental on yourself man, you are so young, you can  always start again. Bring back that old you that was cheerful, and smart, and dynamic. I KNOW you can.

DM me, we'll talk more. OP don't do it. You're not a failure, no you're absolutely not! My dear friend. When you read this (I sure home you do) know that you don't owe this fucking world and your parents a thing. You are not trapped even if you think you are. You have what it takes the tell the world to fuck off and make your own rules. Do not get bogged down with people's expectations of what it means to be successful. You are the only one who can define and know what makes you happy. Spend time and money on yourself. Think of what you'd miss. Pets, your favorite foods, tv series, the ability to travel, see beautiful places and faces 

I hope you see this friend. Loads of love to you. Is there any way to know if he's fine? Friends are social investments where time is the currency and a little bit of luck is the seed. You will make some and lose some. I am glad you put your thoughts here and people are helping you out. Stay strong. You need to look at the better side of things, life is not just about a job. You will get other job or can do some other things in life. I will suggest you to take total break for few days. Take 2 weeks off from work and go travel and spend time for yourself. 
Most importantly talk to people you trust and seek professional help. Hey. Seems like we're on the same boat. 

DM me ASAP. 

I talked with several people through Reddit having almost Same issues as you. I don't know I can help you or not but please let me try. I also used to and still alone and unemployed. So I think our aloneness can be togetherness. 

please don't take any unnecessary steps. If you read this, send me a DM. Let's talk. These feelings are not exclusive to you, many people have them. You need help and support, not an ""end"". I hope you get better. Please don’t take any extreme steps dude. Just read the replies here for once. Life is much more than this. Just talk to us; talk to someone and it will all feel better. People do care about you! PM me, I was in a worse situation than you but have sorted my life out. I'm sure I can show you something cool ! OP, listen to this guy. I did not get job for 4 years after engineering in my domain, then changed domain and started from scratch. Never lose hope. OP please don't do it please. It's not as hopeless as it seems to you right now. I've been there. So glad i didn't do it. So much happened and now it seems so stupid that i ever considered it. The world is huge and there are so many possibilities. Please come and talk. I'm here to talk with you, please message me. I am in the exact same situation. Also did my Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation and my skill set sucks. No friends and nobody who gives a shit about me and I believe I'd take the same route as you in the next 4-6 years. I am saving this so I could use this in the future. First of all, you should immediately seek counselling.

Secondly, your language skills (not your strength in English, but the way you form statements and put it down) gives me an impression that you're not as dumb as you've described yourself. In fact, it shows a very well developed mind who knows how to use words and write. I just checked your post history, it shows a couple of posts in /r/WritingPrompts and also in /r/SuicideWatch. I don't know what to make of all of this. If you're not making this up, I repeat you have to seek counselling immediately. I am trying to report this post anyway. Dude, atleast you should've talked to us once before making up your mind.

I hope you're still there.

Reply to us. We will help you. Talk to your parents man. Just give them a call and  tell them about how you feel. They will surely help you out. Please don't end your life. Its ok to feel these thoughts my friend, Take care of yourself and I hope you don’t do what you intending of doing. This might be the point in your life where things finally turn around. Don't give up!!! OP you could easily pivot your career path in software testing be it Performance testing, API testing ,Selenium Automation testing etc Please think about your family before taking any decision. You going away makes matters worse for your parents.

If not about yourself, think about the driver of the truck the next time when you have such thoughts while on the street. Imagine the guilt he will live with. 

Please please talk to someone, anyone of us if you feel alone. Just went through OP's comments and posts. I am so sorry you have been facing these issues for a long time now. Hang in there, everything will be alright! Hey man ! I have been through the same and come out of it too. All I can tell is to stop comparing with others and start pushing your limit . It feels like shit for a couple of years straight (It did for me) but then I improved. I got better and realised a pattern to pushing myself. You too can do it. Don't do it. Just give life a chance. Don't have too many expectations from yourself. The purpose of life is not to be successful or happy. The purpose of life is to observe and experience it. If you can do that, be it by singing a song, reading a book or talking to a person, do it. 

Do this : If you can, go outside right now, and give 10 rupees to a beggar. If you can't find one, just try to help anyone you can, with any small act possible. Then think about the decision you were making. I’m sorry but don’t do it, there are lots of startup’s looking for different kind of people and not just engineering. I would ask you to take a vacation for yourself and think about all the good things happened in your lives. Stay strong my man. Pls listen to me, this may be a far reach but have you heard of vigyan samagam, search for it, there are 7 mega science projects and out of those 7, at least 6 or maybe all of them need instrumentation engineers who can start afresh. CGPA doesn't matter, they need actual talent which can be applied in those projects. they need people who are fresh, as in who can appreciate the physics and provide the engg skills needed for those projects. Please visit them, apply for jobs there, you may have a chance. I myself am a b.tech student, so I do know what is the placement scenario. Do not give up my mate...
Especially for your parents ....

Every other kid in India has a story exactly like you...infact you might have had a better life as you got placed into a good company...some are still looking for jobs..

The grass is always greener on the other side..
So value what you have..and maybe change your job and get some perspective before deciding anything...

I remember a similar post here from some time back...not sure if it was you..

Take it easy... Bro please reply I am scared for you. I wish I had the words that will make you feel better right away, but I don't. 

I know things might seem a little blurry right now but it will get better, just don't give up. 

If you think you are out of options, trust me ( and I've learned the hard way) there are infinite possible options that will make you feel better and motivate you to better yourself. 
I also know, that you can't think of those options right now, but I don't blame you. I just want to assure you, things can get better. 



Does anyone know if he's alright
Seriously OP if you are reading this, you need counselling, but  if you can't afford it right now,  don't hesitate to DM me, I am sure I can help you in some way, at least make you feel better. Is it possible to report this incident to some authority so as to check up on him? It’s all self pity and disdain until you see someone in a worse situation pull through and ultimately emerge victorious. If anybody knows op then please let us know why isn't he updating. Or if anyone here had a talk with him then please do let us know. I'm worrying for him. Don't do this. Trust me. 
You've forgotten what you have. 

If you could not achieve more, learn to live in less.

Job is just a small part of life. It can be changed. 

Find another passion.

There is so much more to be seen. 

Don't do it. 

Instead, kill your ego.. Read some philosophy. You will find peace. Trust me, I've been there. There isn't just one way to earn money. So many things you can do. I believe in you man! You can do great. Just focus on the right things! It's not too late! Find something in life that you like. It can be hobby  or an interest.  Job is to fill your stomach and unless you have interest in it, you will feel depressed and you need something to look forward to.. It will get better. Just talk with someone. Call your parents. Go home for sometime.
Maybe being away from family is not for you. [https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Snoopyrun/)   


Please stay hopeful brother. We love you just the way you are. In the end everything will be okay if not it is not the end. Did anybody hear back from OP?  I hope he is OK. Dude do meditation and start your medication on OCD or go rehab if it helps. Join other jobs like call centre and start small fuck other people who just talk stay connected to people who provide some important info on jobs and creativity. Bring your hobbies into action it helps mentally and try to make money from it. Start trekking get close to nature and others too its good and fast money.

Life ko happy rakhna sikh lo bhai Friend, you are not defined by your failures or successes. You can turn all this around, you can be happy -- I promise. Don't give up, I beg you. We're all in this together, and you can look to others for support. 

Please don't give up. Are bhai I too feel my education has failed somewhat in logical reasoning. I'm starting small with learning pure maths and related books. I suggest you the same, it might be hard to find time but find whatever time and do it. Also.. take the meds. I am probably in a worse situation (in terms of career) than you. I am 28, with family and social situation similar to you. I have been taking exams for government jobs without success. I do not have any job experience. 
I have been depressed for so long that it feels like a part of me now. I too have suicidal thoughts almost on a daily basis. I can relate to the nihilism and OCD pattern you wrote about. I have no control over my negative thoughts. But, there are times when I feel nothing at all. 
You clearly need psychiatric help to deal with it. You should at least watch mental health related videos and talks on YouTube. 
Please, just stay strong. Here is a Frank Herbert quote that always helps me - ""The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience."" Hope you feel better soon. [deleted] [removed] Ignore the other comments.

You are making a decision that affects you and only you. 



If this means that you won't suffer anymore, then I'm happy for you.




I don't understand why the holier than thou commenters think that life is absolutely worth it.


If you are literally so broken then you don't have to go on. You can end your suffering once and for all. 


I'd rather suggest posting this on r/antinatalism or r/suicidewatch (if you're still there). They are supportive and won't bash you and force you to live just cuz bUt mUh LiFe iS a GiFt. [removed] [removed]"
Science/Technology,India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology,15,7tahs2,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-shed-intellectual-colonialism-to-excel-in-science-and-technology/story-wfbhX71Evf9ilqqUKkjAQL.html,6,1517057930.0,,s18m," Language is least of the issues with science and technology in India. The entire education system is based on the Sharma ji ka beta ko 90% mila tereko 89.9999 kyun mila ? system. The rat race is for marks and not for imparting basic education irrespective of the language.  LOL, fuckers really like tampering with education. How about saying to no to learning *vaimanika shastra* and *gomutra yagnas* etc?

Science isn't intellectual colonialism.By teaching it in Enlish, you are just ensuring that children are able to hook up on research at a global scale directly rather than be mediated by translators. 

Also, fuck your hindi-speaker employment schemes.

 How about NO.  
We need English and it needs to be promoted further.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one’s native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

I know & respect Dr Vijayaraghavan immensely, but this is just bollocks. We don't spend sufficiently on education (primary & higher education), what exists is a rat race for 'marks' & not learning, and on top of that, we spend a pittance on research. What little we do has been captured in most institutes by entrenched interests. Let's fix all that and then talk about language.

I'm saying that as a supporter for having the first few years of primary education in the mother tongue."
Science/Technology,Calculus created in India 250 years before Newton: study - Technology & Science,145,2p81f0,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/calculus-created-in-india-250-years-before-newton-study-1.632433,146,1418549793.0,,sjain75," Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.

Anyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.

While I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).

So no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be ""Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West"".

This is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.

Regardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.

>""There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,"" he said. ""A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.""

>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.

>""There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,"" he admits.

I think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.

I think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. 

>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today

The researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. 

 V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. 

Anyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. 

We know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. 

So even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.
 Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn't matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy's facebook page if you don't beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn't matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus. ITT : not history not a lot of math, does not compute at all."
Science/Technology,"‘The most terrifying moments’: India counts down to risky Moon landing | If touchdown is successful, Chandrayaan-2 will be the first lunar mission to explore the south pole.",1737,czf5wi,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02587-4,217,1567594990.0,,I1I8I1I," Fingers crossed! but I am sure it will be successful. Wishing all the very best to ISRO! For people asking why ISRO is doing this:

We need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base. So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel. But moon's gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargo.

To set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals. Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don't have to transport from earth. 

For ISRO along with all this, it's the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.

Edit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:

Because we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.

If you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it's too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important. Also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth, next step is the solar system (May be Mars and Titan-One of the Jupiter's Moon)

If something were to happen to earth it's impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology, but we can definitely save the human race. Here is the thing about space exploration: if you aren't doing it yourself, down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did. It's simple as that.

If isro wasn't doing its thing all this while, we would've been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs, military tech and for million other reasons.

So if you are questioning why it's important to explore moon and other places, it's not for you. Maybe it's for the next generation, or the one after that. Or 10 generations from now.

Do we owe it to them? Hell yeah! Why? Because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasn't created in our own generation with our resources, and so onus is on us to be not Dicks and handicap future generations. *Mereko aisa dhak dhak sa horela hai* *Bhai lund kara de, 500₹ extra le lena* Thanks for posting an article from Nature instead of garbage news sites. The lander of chandrayann 2 named 'Vikram' will land on lunar surface on 7th of September when its rover 'Pragyan' will roll out from 'Vikram' to carry out experiments on the lunar surface for a period of one lunar day which is equal to 14 earth days.The lander has already left the orbiter and is descending toward the moon's surface. I wish everything will come out well as most of the citizens have set their hopes on this mission and their hopes and expectations will do wonders. Fingers crossed. Since I am seeing a lot of negative comments on why we are doing this,  Wouldn't it be better to use this money on education / other things. 

Dude, this is not much money. And education and other things already have budget allowance. We aren't even using that money optimally, so throwing money to other things is not an answer. 


Also, what do you want from our high iq scholars? Work in banks or become IAS instead of becoming scientist, or migrate to NASA? Which most of them are already doing. You want to stop brain drain and want those NASA scientists to return to India, but don't want create jobs for them. 

Also, our satellite and space data can predict cyclones, weather and other things. Should we shut down isro? 


We spend more on Mayawati statues, cricket stadiums and politicians foreign trips then on isro. So the reality is, ISRO budget is not enough, and we need to increase it to support science. ""terrifying"" ???

Why is this word being misused in many chandrayaan articles. Who is being terrified/terrorised and frightened ?

It gives the impression that the scientists are just blindly doing things without confidence, hoping that it touches down. Or Like a student who has not not studied at all & appearing for exams

A more suitable word could be challenging, suspense etc.. Astronomy noob here. Please elaborate what's the context of exploring South Pole? Moon's South Pole or Earth's South Pole? All the children in the comments who are arguing whether this mission is needed or not, it's adorable. Fingers crossed. If they lose contact,just tell tapsee pannu to switch the control system on and off once. /s

All the best! A major question in the comment section is how will space exploration help common people or why is space exploration necessary. Here's my two cents

Space exploration is the pinnacle of science and technology. It is the region where we push the frontiers of knowledge, wisdom. Why push stuff you ask? Because pushing is what generates something new. It's about creating a necessity which then causes inventions. Our cameras, computers, batteries, jet fuels, propulsion systems etc all of them are direct beneficiaries of space exploration. Satellites are behind internet, TV, GPS, cellular network. Not even one of those is dispensable.

Parker probe (the one sent to sun) necessitated the invention of materials that could withstand huge thermal loads. Mars rover would eventually result in more efficient helicopters. Coming to this particular mission, the landing site is unexplored. ANY finding there is going to result in better understanding of our universe.

Speaking of purely monetary terms, ISRO launches satellites of other nations which brings profits. The reliability to price ratio of ISRO is very high which brings many customers.

Take out all of this. Space exploration provides employment.  The money spent on a rocket is not going to waste, it is going back into economy and coming back to the government too in the name of taxes. 

If you can think of ANY other field that could provide inspiration and employment to millions, better our understanding of universe, push for a better technology, be my guest. You know it's scientifically important af if Nature is covering it. Full power to the mission control team and everyone involved. This has been a wonderful project that has really put is out there as one of the stronger nations when it comes to space exploration. Hope it all works out well and we are able to execute all that has been planned for the mission. Godspeed and Jai Hind! It carries the hopes of more than 1.3 billion people. I hope it's a success [for interested people](https://imdb.com/title/tt1772240/). It involves lunar south pole. On 7th September, India will be the first nation to land a machine and study the south pole on Moon. Moon is the 1st step for the interplanetary human civilization of the near future. 1st Moon, then Mars and the NEO asteroids, then the belt - it will unlock unimaginable wealth for mankind. The cost of space exploration is going down with advanced technology. Hopefully, in the near future we would be able to remove our polluting industries and mining to space to make the earth and the ocean pristine again. Best of luck ISRO. Asking out of curiosity, why doesn't India has a ISS lab / module ? Why is it suddenly ""If touchdown is successful""? Have we lost faith in ISRO already? Let's not be so pessimistic. Hope for the success! Veery very true that Indians are unique and doing awesome things with this unique ness The opening words are  ""countless setbacks and delays"". Not sure if that is entirely true. I really never understood the purpose of such mission.

I mean why they want to  explore moon, for water and minerals ? But why ...isn't earth is enough for discovering that. 

Why we need water on moon, we can't civilise million of people like earth ,and even if we find minerals what can we do with it. Like mining them.  ? Is that easy.. economical. It's extremely difficult and I don't think it's economical too

People want to occupy Mars, i never understood why we need Mars. 

We have on earth sufficient minerals and forests , we just failed to properly exploit it without affecting environment.

Millions of people are dying of hunger and many diseases, education has pathetic standards.

For me it's just a show off thing , so that we can show off to rich nation that we also can do same. But we failed to understand Europe USA Japan China are far more developed than India, it's like hobby for them to explore moon Mars Saturn with extra pile of cash.

We have far more important problems than mere spending money on useless mission, it's okay we do such mission when we get developed fairly well then it makes sense 


Health, environment pollution, disaster management , sustainable energy are to be focused more and we need more research on these issues. 

We are spending millions of dollars on finding water on moon , while millions of people don't get water on earth.

Thanks for downvotes  😇 #sillymilestone Can we navigate this unmanned object to the location of the US Flag and debunk the Moon conspiracy once and for all? Please? So, India is going to explore the South pole of the moon.  I bet they find a bunch of dirt, rock, no trees, no grass, no life.  WOW big science."

I'm as much of a BJP detractor as anyone you'll find. But at the same time, there are a few things I know:

* Yoga has legit benefits

* Meditation is known to change thought patterns. Legit shit.

* Not all ayurveda is quackery. Head over to /r/nootropics and read about how different ayurvedic herbs act as nootropics. Sure, it won't save you from cancer, but some of this stuff has benefits. 


Nothing wrong with studying any of these in detail. Ministry of Pseudoscience Excellent use of state resources.

 I will forever be grateful to BJP if they let Hinduism alone. But who am I kidding?  But 2002!

Modi's haters will keep scaremongering about how he will start an orgy of Muslim blood and destroy India.

And whenever he proves them wrong(which is always) they will desperately go back and rake up 2002 again.

This will be their fate for the remainder of their natural lives. They will still be talking about 2002 in 2052. Fuck the elections. You want to see who wins? See who's the friendliest towards the West. Which almost always means they ignore the people. The US has all of their telemarketers and troubleshooters here, they dump all their plastic garbage not far from Chennai, and we provide Trillions in education money and then we stay back there to fill their coffers. 

Meanwhile ours is rapidly a dumping ground of the dregs of the human gene pool. The intelligent procreate less, or emigrate, therefore they will be evolved out of the gene pool.

Crowd management is total failure there The rich brought the virus to our soil, and the poor are the ones that suffer.
While people I know are trying to figure out where they’d get their next packet of cigarettes from, migrant workers are on the streets breaking down on the sight of food to eat, and a clean bottle of water.
I feel so helpless that I can’t physically do more than just rant on the Internet. I hate this feeling. [deleted] Fuck. I wasn't ready for this.

Can't imagine the trauma 1000s are going through away fron their families with no food or shelter.

Really puts things in perspective when you see such things.

How can the government choose to ignore this. Empathy nahi hai saalo mein.

Hindu Muslim Right Left doesn't matter. Humanity should come first. Those aren’t tears of gratitude. Please don’t mistake them for that. Sure, there is some gratitude behind them, but know this: behind every tear the poor shed, there is restrained anger, hidden shame, wounded pride. Every one of those tears is telling them that this is no way of living, only to have to live like that for many, many days to come. Someone will come who will weaponize those emotions and no tyrant will be able to stand against them. For now, all we can do is hope that such a day will come.’ I'm kinda torn about this. On the one hand I see the importance of letting the country know how bad the situation has become. On the other, I think taking a  video of this man crying steals the few shreds of dignity he has left. Yaar koi reliable ngo/organisation doing something about this? How can we help?! Source - https://twitter.com/aaqibrk/status/1243594510480707585?s=19 And here I am sitting at my home complaining over small things, seeing this video made me think how undeserving I am, this man probably busts his ass all day providing for his family and that's a normal day.... I can even begin to imagine what so many people are going through, it's as if we are all on a ship and they have been left in the cold dark sea, just with a floater.... I pray they get through this. And the people helping them are absolute heroes. Wish they reach home soon.. We have failed as a society. Imagine being recorded while you shed tears of pain Man this really puts things into perspective. How life can be difficult, unforgiving. At one moment you leave for a city far away with dreams, ambition and hope. And at another all of that is taken from you.  More people are going to suffer due to the unemployed caused by coronavirus than coronavirus itself. This is sad. Very sad. I lost my sadism and sarcasm looking at this i am serious. I never feel so helpless upon seeing these people. No one deserve to face such. 
I couldn't control my tears. Still thinking why. Corona virus has revealed real, terrible holes in our system. We have an economy that heavily relies on efforts of exactly those who used up and chewed out and treated like dirt.

If we learn anything from this crises, let it be the fact that our neoliberal, capitalist society has time and time again failed vast majority of its participants because of lack of humanity of the process. We need to wake up or this becomes a new normal. Good to see people are coming forward. While it wont do a lot, it is a good place to start. The most shocking part is that some people are blaming these poor folks for the situation. They also applaud each time they see police brutality in the name of this lockdown. Empathy is pretty much dead I think in India. Ok, i get it... it is emotional... but don't zoom in when someone is breaking down..give them some privacy In spite of being a huge critic of Modi, I appreciated the decision of lockdown he took. But at that point of time, I didn't consider the situation of these workers. Of course, he has a team of specialists so they must have known what is gonna happen regarding this. So I don't understand why they couldn't give any time for these workers to reach their villages beforehand by announcing the lockdown a couple of days ahead. All our money is of no use if we can't do anything for humanity. on top of that we are fed hindu muslim pakistan everyday. UP government has recently allotted 1,000 buses to bring people back home. I wish I can make a difference in the world when I grow up 💔 To all my fellow Indians, at a time like this, those of us who have the luxury to stay home and have the means to help others should take care of the less fortunate. We cannot just blame the government and expect them to take care of each an every individual. It is important we the regular people do our part. You can find some NGO to donate to, I hope some here can provide a link of a reliable one but it is better if you find a local initiative in your community. If you dont have one then start one, but it is important if each person contributes to their local community Jo bhi ho, from Demonetisation to Lockdown, it is the lower class people who has to suffer. Oh dear...i teared up a bit there. I cant imagine who to thank the relative comfort i have in life. That lad will do something for himself. The circumstances that have led him and countless others to this situation are so out of their control that tears seem appropriate. I wish him well. Isn't there anything us commoners can do for them from our homes??? Rula diya vencho T_T Why the fuck are they being filmed like that ? A man's having a weak moment. Give them their fucking space. Gosh. Seems more like a gimmick. Sad to see this... I assume this situation is coz of landlords who asked these people to vacate houses as in these times they cannot pay rent. 

From what I know the first migrant worker sets up a base in the city and establishes himself... takes more work and calls more people from his village convincing their families that he'll earn a good amount. They stay in groups of 6-8 or more.

Here's the states responsibility of not creating enough jobs is the prime reason. We also should have a threshold limit of population control for each city.  Jo ye bichare jis pareshani se jhuujh rahe hai wo kisi bhi pandemic se badi hai Income inequality aur poverty itni badi emergency ko hum sabne kabhi ek problem k taur per nhi dekha. Aaj Covid19 ne jo life k matrix mein glitch daal k hum sabki aankhein kholi hai usse shayad humari Insaniyat wapas aa Jaye. 


I know many chutiyas in my family who will blame everything on Illuminati and then entire day they will bitch and be toxic to every person they meet but somehow praying to God makes them a better person . These deluded imbeciles are the main reasons why politicians win elections kyonki simple minded ko apeel karne k liye bhashan kaafi hai aur aise deluded log kabhi khud ko nhi Question karte. /u/vredditdownloader I'm out of words. This breaks my heart, i hope they reach home safe and sound . This is honestly so fucking sad I am feeling sad for them Damn its tough to watch a grown man breaking apart like that. It's always the poor who suffer the most during time like these. I have nothing but to thank those beautiful souls providing food. Fuck. This broke my heart This made me cry. I beg the government to atleast provide them shelters or transport to reach their homes. The poor always suffers in this nation. Guys please donate to PM CARES fund. what are some legit charities / foundations we can donate to and ensure that our money is well spent These people are the ones building our homes, roads, bridges and the country. It fucking breaks my heart seeing them like this that they are facing hardships getting even a plate of food. Guys, Do you know any NGOs that I can donate to? A trusted NGO? It's so easy to forget about this part of our country while sitting in a well furnished room with all basic amenities. (Myself included). Whoever helps during these times, I wish them every happiness and comfort in their lives. I wish I was earning to contribute in some way. It's ironic but I will say it anyway - ""Together we stand"". The tears from him explain how important food is.  I hope the donors provide free food daily until they have their regular wages. Is there anything Modi does with proper planning? I couldn’t help but break down looking at this. How can I send money to help them ? This gave me chills. Anyone who is privileged enough to be on reddit from the comfort of their homes should be very very grateful. But we all know we will never be. So my tax money goes to netas ghar, 10-20Rs ki chicken in government premises, traveling abroad, buying private jets... This post is not written by drawn into emotions. All of this migration could have been avoided if Modi would have worked with state governments to feed everyone who is out of regular wages (like community kitchen opened across Kerala during this pandemic). Instead he did the usual drama, probably not even consulting his ministers. This migration is going to be the equivalent of army personnels spreading spanish flu to the nooks and corners of Europe. I appreciate the effort and concern but just imagine going into the face of man with a camera/phone and recording him breaking down in tears thats not good. Its partially gratitude and partially embarrassment. 

One of the hardest things for anybody in this world is to accept help. It's hard for a man to ask for help. A grown man who did all he could to make an honest living breaks down because of a pandemic. 

I feel so helpless and hopeless looking at this suffering but honestly the reality is I felt so good about myself just because of the sadness this makes me feel. 

It makes me feel better, 
than that someone, who doesn’t care. 

The complaining and the sorrow is essentially my coping mechanism for the tragedy that this is. 

I broke down slightly this morning, when I spoke to my father asking him to make sure the workers in our small shop are taken care of(because of this post). 
I made sure he didn’t notice my tears.

Namesake are those tears or even selfish at best. 

I wish there was someone that i could pin this on.

Other than the fact that this is a world that we live in and so we carry on.

Many of these people won’t make it. But I am sure I will.

At least I will make it out of this better than most. 
Thank the lottery that these brothers lost
And I won. While it is truly moving, I wish the person filming gave the man some dignity, and did not take the camera to his face.

These are tough times. Remember, United We Stand. I don't know how right I am , but I still think instead of  arrangements of Busses to travel back home UP govt. should have invested in Tents or supplies for our fellow migrants workers, for they shouldn't have to be forced to walk back home.

When asked in various news sources almost everyone said ""Paise Khatam ho gye hai, hum bhukey hai kai dino se, Corona se pehle to hum bhuuk se mar jayenge.""

(Translation: We are hungry and not eaten for many days and we have no money left and will die of hunger even before Corona gets us.)

Maybe, just maybe I think they made arrangements for busses because I don't for sure but i think we didn't have enough funds to feed this many people. So they decided to let every help them there houses instead.
But this might backfire as they are so desperate right now that they don't care for social distancing and all. Well its not there fault , as one in this times would be. But there's a risk of carrying the virus in great numbers to their respective villages. 

Damn. If China would have put a permanent Ban on some animal traded in there Wet Markets learning from SARS and also have not suppressed they Doc. who tried to Warn their Govt. about this virus.. Things would have been way different.. I dislike - immensely - the camera angle.

Hear me out: to be standing \*over\* the desperate, at a time when eating ( usually a rather 'private' activity in rural areas) and while these migrants are seated on a rough road...makes me even sadder.

Everything about this situation is despicable. 

Ok - the ""so what would you have done"" - I would have crouched down to a lower level, explained that I would like to take images in order to help get more food/relief for others via social media/MADia and only then taken images

My 2c I understand the intention of filming this, but it comes off as poverty porn. Esp the zoom on the crying. Social media has made charity moments so much worse than those donate videos on TV. To stop you from watching this, they did this:

 *“In a country where people are afraid of criticizing the government,  many things must be going horrible! In such countries people must know  that a society of cowards will always be remembered as a society of  honourless people!”* Seriously Guys., Learnt and  Educated North Indian Folks who have voted for BJP, take a minute and think what you have done in right or worng. The way Indian government is handling this is pathetic. You cannot close down the entire country without making sure that everyone gets food, water, and other essentials, regardless of whether they're rich or poor. The way things are set up now, only the privileged few can afford to self isolate. This will end pretty badly. 

I hope the government realises this soon and sets up rations delivery to every citizen. u/VredditDownloader Man this hurts Damn. never felt so helpless before ever. Not just about this, but everything going on. I'm about to graduate from a ""premium"" university with a ""highly sought after degree"". But I've never felt so helpless before. u/vRedditDownloader [deleted] u/vredditdownloader 😭😭😭😭 Where is this? u/__panda101__ This is absolutely heartbreaking.. These are really tough time, I hope more good people like these comes out to help.
This video really got me😢 Do you guys have any clue on how someone can help out during this crisis ? Other than practicing social distancing and staying at home ofcourse. 🙏🏼 This is going to haunt is forever.... This is sad. Government didn't thought this through Humanity will never ever forgive us for what we do to them repeatedly year after year. Why post the poor man's plight out in public? This is not a responsible post. Good work lads!!Pr yeh piche se chutiya kon hai pagal ho kya😂😂 There must be so many thoughts going in their mind - their job, money, how and when will they be able to reunite with their family and then food. These are uncertain and very tough times. I hope they all reach their homes safely and without getting infected. Praying for everyone. Is there some way we can help them? u/vredditdownloader /U/vredditdownloader Yes let’s film them What can we do to help? Actual effective initiatives? Assuming that I can donate my time and effort more than money(Kinda broke, lol). Opportunities to volunteer? Fuck what times are we living in. For fuck sake this needs to end. This is fucking heartbreaking! bc yese logo k le kuch karna h life mai If this lockdown/pandemic doesn't teach us to decentralise jobs and development throughout the country, and equitable distribution of livelihood, nothing ever will. We need to tackle this now, PERIOD PLEASE! How can we help? Does anyone know any genuine NGO that has taken on the task of helping the poor during the lock down? If someone knows any dependable organization that we can donate to? I'm not donating to any sarkari funds anymore so please don't suggest that. This is sad. Please stay strong. How can I help? So hungry. Thank goodness they recorded it, otherwise it would have been all in vain. It's unfair the people who are paying the price are the ones who will further be discriminated if they contract the virus. 

In days we ll see affluent get better care than the rest. lock-down was imminent 

but is there government help for all the employed and unemployed?

awaiting news.... Migrant workers are really taking the hit. They do not have home or saving like us to take the blunt of crisis. These people live and feed themselves on daily wage so can't lock themselves like us. If this virus hit India like US then Generations are going to remember this for a long time. I can’t imagine what’s like being offered food. I am very glad they are in India. Even though it has huge population and is very god country. helping hands reach every corner at tough times as every government scheme rwxhes every rural area. Ofcourse some goes unnoticed, everything can't be taken care of. They should be glad, they are back again in India and they will be taken care of. u/vredditdownloader no touching face ! These are tough times for everyone😞 Oh my god. My heart aches so much seeing this. Dear friends please stand up for one another. this chaos is because of unplanned lockdown by the govt This is heart-breaking, I cannot imagine the plight of these migrant workers. But he should not have been touching his face like that... Not during times like these. Hope this NGO offered sanitizers before giving them food. Both central and state governments have massively fucked up, everyone knew what was coming and still these people were left to die. [removed] why are they migrating back to villages, can't they stay in Delhi and Delhi govt can take care of the food and basic stuff. Shame on system!! IMO it is utterly insensitive & cruel to shoot on mobile phones like that when people in need & bad situation are eating an offered meal on road...its as cruel as shooting someone's video while dying.. these are self respecting & self earning individuals having a rough patch due to no falt of theirs but due to the knee jerk reaction by their government w/o any planning or addressing their valid concerns behind all the panic. Pseudo-entitled chutiyas on my feed are defending and patting the Govt on the back for this.

They really should be put through such circumstances so that next time they think of the 80% population who goes hand-to-mouth.

Fucking boils my blood on what have we elected to govern us. Heart-breaking, that's all I can say. What are the leaders doing? Playing Ramayana and promoting some narrative. Poor guy. I know exactly how that feels like. They deserve much more than this. This is barely covering their rights as humans. This government is ruthless... This is heartbreaking :( Why the fuck you filming that guy. Would you like someone to film you when you in this emotional state. For fuck sake give him some space. Shame on the person shooting this. Capturing someone's private emotions without their consent is absolutely deplorable. The least they could have done is blur the face. 

I have a question for you Redditors - how many of you would like your weak moment posted all over the internet, even if it were to prove a legitimate point? The Government should spend money on more infirmaries instead of making statues. If they take this situation as a lesson then next time we would be ready to tackle these kinds of situations. Look at this cunt, hes crying, just gonna stick my camera in his fuckin face Clips like these only serve at appealing to emotions over common sense. Why are migrant workers returning to their native places (and potentially bringing the disease to small villages), instead of sheltering in place? The whole point of shelter in place is to stop the spread of disease. And it’s only mandated for 21 days not indefinite. Here is a thread that I posted about the misery and utter helplessness this unplanned lockdown has resulted in for the labourers and poor. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpx36l/a_thread_on_how_this_regime_with_its_marvellous/ :( r/HumansBeingBros Well, stop fucking filming him then? Do you know how embarrassing it can be to be in a pathetic situation and then someone films your embarrassment?

It makes no difference to anyone whether he was crying or not. Or for fuckity sake atleast be discreet instead of shoving the camera in his face to capture how he breaks down in various photographic angles you sick cock. It would be so awkward for me if people were filming me while doing good things for me. It's like, are you doing this for me, or the cameras? Susashan ki sarkar hai
Lauda ki sarkar hai. I don’t think anyone speaks his language but the guy holding the camera is literally insulting him. He’s saying “get the fuck outta mah country you brow... curry stin... migrant worker! Stop stealing awur jerbs!” Lol maybe don’t leave your home? What a bitch"
Food,"A banner in Delhi requesting people not to leave, food and accommodation will be arranged by Delhi Government",416,frstgc,https://i.redd.it/4wy2vgsjvtp41.jpg,69,1585610805.0,,Neglectedsince1994," I was initially surprised by the exodus of workers. But many interviews have clarified their thinking on the situation and I think it's quite valid. Basically, they're worried that if they fall ill, they have no support net in these city slums. Back home, they at least have family members to take care of them.

Given that politicians often have (or claim to have) their ears to the ground, they should have been aware of this insecurity. I think in hindsight it was better to announce a schedule for the lockdown a few days earlier, transfer funds to their accounts, run maximum number of trains and buses to take everybody back home, let people prepare and stock up, and then start the police curfew lathi raj. Instead, under the excuse of ""preventing panic"", they started with the last first, and now people can neither stay in cities nor go back to their homes, neither have food nor money. *“Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and  ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to  him.”*     

 ―        Mahatma Gandhi The worst thing is he has been asking people for staying back for a number of days now.  Still, the anti-kejriwal propoganda is too high in UP right now I don't think Modi has consulted with state heads before declaring the lock-down and given them some time to prepare or listen to them which could have avoided mass exodus from cities like Delhi. This guy literally enforces ""Na khaunga, Na khane dunga"" - he won't prepare and won't allow other able leaders to prepare at state level. Jokes on Kejri 

Fun story - I was in an auto once at 4 am and the guy keeps asking me sir ye board padho. 
I asked him after reading 4 boards, bhaiyaa aapko chasma hai? 
He replied sir padh pata to ye na chalata Does anyone know if state CMs were told that there would be a lockdown beforehand? Kejriwal, he is such a good man to be a CM. He is gonna win next election too. He did tons of good things for poor and medium class families. Source: Sent by a friend

&#x200B;

Who is this anti naashanal unkill? Clearly this man is an antinational and can't be taken seriously. Everyone I meet keeps saying that the virus won't survive once the summer comes. What they don't understand and what I'm tired of telling them is 1) There is no evidence for the claim. 2) Even if it doesn't survive summer, it will be winter in the southern hemisphere and there the virus can prosper, and then return to Northern Hemisphere after 4-5 months All this Indian immunity shit is fucking bullshit. Take all the necessary precautions please, wherever in the world you are. Not an expert, but from what I know: Viruses evolve very quickly. Given that, isn't it possible that the covid-19 will quickly adapt to Indian conditions? Can someone who is an expert clarify? We are not alien.

Why he's trying so hard to make citizens of other states feel jealous?
Making Kerala god's own country. Kerala also has proactively begun sharing details about contact tracing and released two charts that show the movement of confirmed patients across the state before being diagnosed and quarantine that will help contain spread to some extent. Man this Kerala is 50 years ahead. Pinarayi is a great CM, very rational, scientific and a logical guy. Rest of the BJPee chutiyas are talking about gomutra I hope CPI-M revives it's cadres in other states too. We need them to play a formidable part in the opposition. There are not communist party in the hard-core sense now

There are trying to repackage themselves along the lines of socialist parties in Europe His statement was for the people who are suspected patients and not coming forward. Getting treatment, food and internet will make them feel comfortable and not left out. I bet Shylaja teacher is behind this strategy. She is the best health minister we have known till date.

Edit: grammer We'll see a catastrophe unfold whenever this thing hits the ill-equipped and lesser competent states. Rest of India: Hindu Muslim, Hindu Muslim, ANTI NATIONAL!!!

Kerala: feels good to hear about the steps they have taken Haha as long as there's good connectivity, I'm fine. I saw the press con. It was really smartly played, if people of the state work together then it's easy to stop its contagion. Multiple warnings are issued to people who haven't yet gotten tested. And, the charts released are a big help too. Smartly the first priority is identifying the victims, and while identification takes place the government works on the secondary issues such as bandwidth, food etc. Gotta say I was impressed. Who would have thought a communist party will be so good under a democracy Meanwhile in Delhi - no work from home for lazy and dishonest citizens! Commies just doing what Govts are supposed to do. Every state/central govt should learn from Kerala's government. Can someone please point to the link to the twitter thread/video where this was said? 

I am not questioning the truth but the link attached by OP does not say what the title says. When zombies start walking from North, Kerala will be the last ray of hope. Do it for my lifetime, and I will never have to come out of my house. Does anyone else find it strange that large population centers like Mumbai are reporting nothing? In a dispersed and connected world, Mumbai would have showed up by now one would think. Either Mumbai is really lucky or Mumbai isnt checking anything at all.

Food,American wondering how to tactfully refuse food,83,fw3ws1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw3ws1/american_wondering_how_to_tactfully_refuse_food/,32,1586225965.0,"So I live in America and work in the home of a family from India. I tutor their child. Since schools have cancelled for the year in my state they have increased my hours, meaning that I am around for lunchtime now, and they have absolutely INSISTED on feeding me. This is very nice of them and all of the food they have made me is delicious, but they give me so much! I'll tell them that I'm full but then they'll bring me another portion, and I feel like I must eat it because it would be rude to refuse. Is there a way to tactfully tell them when I've had enough food? The last thing I want to do is disrespect their generosity!",ouchmytongue," Welcome to Indian kitchens. This is universal, and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left. This way you can eat their final serving, and continue to flatten your curve as well, so to speak.

Edit: Do bring in a dessert sometime. Return the favour! Indian families generally insist on serving more food until you INSIST you are full. It’s a cultural thing. 

In older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. 

These days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.

Another thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.

Thank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied. 

Hope this helps. Oh boy...I have some good tips for you..

1) eat slow
2) when you are done, quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate...so the plate becomes unservable
3) just get up and wash your hands when done ....no eye contact. 


Tried and tested in the field.
P.S: all techniques tested on my wife's family where I face the same issue. I am fasting today. Typical Indian household lol. It's endearing in a way but tbh I always feel like I can't walk or that I am going to throw up.

Just insist that you are full and just ask small quantities of different varieties of food. It wont be that bad once they are used to have you around during lunchtime and get familiar with your portion sizes. Just eat real slow, they will get it that you are having trouble finishing it. Tell them that you will ask if you want more, or that you will take the food by yourself when you want more (e.g tell them “you guys also eat, I’ll take how much ever I want, I don’t want to trouble you”) . Eat slow to match speed of others eating in the house. Or tell that if you eat a lot, you will end up feeling ill. Initially Smile and after 2-3 times, tell politely but firmly with semi-serious face. Many years ago, a fellow American friend I knew in Dilli consumed an entire stick of butter out of politeness. The cultural norm is that as a guest, if you actually do want to be served more food, you only refuse ***mildly.*** Guests will usually not directly say - ""Yes, I do want more"". Instead they will just not protest too strongly when the hosts are serving you more food. So, when you actually do become full and definitely don't want more, you have to politely but very firmly say no. You have to insist, like one of the other comments said. Don't worry, it's not rude. Another tip is - eat slowly. If you finish too fast, they'll think you're still hungry. Why do you think most Indians have a potbelly and are generally unfit? I don't understand what it is with Parents and relatives that they will always put more than you need in your plate and think that its healthy to eat more while it's clearly not. My diet always gets screwed because of my parents overfeeding me even if I refuse to eat more. They just put more on the plate and I have to eat because I don't like wasting food. I need to be more stern otherwise I have to spend more time with my dumbells to shed those extra carbs. Refusing food is not rude unless you do it rudely an option is to tell them that because of the coronavirus thing you have started a special diet as you have more time or to enhance your health something. You may have to skip lunch entirely though. Fast for a day I'd say it's better to say you're full, since it works like a charm for me. TBH it's my family hence I don't get pushed too often. It is typical of many families to insist one more portion to ensure even the meek leave with full tummy. Some hosts keep on feeding even if they might not have sufficient for themselves. They also believe that 

The way you’d refuse - once you have eaten to your liking, say that you liked it so much that you already are full to your heart’s content and do not have room for more. Say you don’t shy from food and if needed you’ll ask for more by yourself (say this in a jolly tone). Also, as others have said, physically block them from serving another portion by holding your hand slightly above your plate or bowl. That’s an accepted way of saying you don’t want more. Tell them you have an upset stomach. That's what I do! Something I do, but only if people are very insistent: I yank my plate off the table and protect it with my hand until the other person retreats.

&#x200B;

This absolute last resort, but if your plate isn’t there, they can’t serve you. you should say that you are following very strict diet plan. Relax. It's just culture. You have to refuse lovingly, three or four times before they'll stop asking. Tell them you had something to eat already somewhere else. say you have allergies. Keep passing comments like,

* today the food is a little oily

* salt is less in the food today

* I think the gravy stinks, was it yesterday's dish you recycled?

* Roti could've been softer

*  Daal at the house next door at Sharma's is tastier


if they still offer you food. Quit

edit: Clearly this is being taken as a serious comment. I was in the mood to shit post. My bad. Take but don't eat. I know its not good to waste food but it's perhaps the only way. Ensure that the food gets wasted by may be mixing curries with staple, half eating sweets etc. When they ask you, say you are full and can't eat anymore. They will still continue giving excessive food to you for a few days. But then they will start paying heed to your words gradually.

Food,how safe it is to order online food from Zomato or swiggy right now?,44,fx3b4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx3b4e/how_safe_it_is_to_order_online_food_from_zomato/,23,1586366389.0,"i am surviving alone in my room by eating oatmeal, maggi and other fast food. it's been a week since I had a real meal. The hunger inside me is unbearable right now.

I checked swiggy, some restaurants are providing safety standards while making order , I am really wondering how safe it is to order from Zomato and swiggy.?",Devoid29," it's safe as long as you didn't came in direct contact with the delivery person and your food is properly cooked Dude. Learn to cook if you have stove or induction. 

Seriously, it is an essential life skill and you also have time at hand. YouTube and experiment the hell out of it. It is not that hard. Throw out the container the food comes in asap and wash your hands , don’t let the container touch anything in your house 

Reheat the food in a microwave or a tawa for a few mins I had pizza about a week ago (after eating at home for nearly a month) from a local pizza place. The delivery guy wore gloves but I removed the pizza from its box anyway, put it in a home container, binned the box, washed my hands well, and ate the most goddamn delicious pizza of my life. FML or YOLO, only time will tell. I would err against ordering food from outside. This is strictly a hypothesis and feel free to disprove it. 

With restaurant sales plummeting I wouldn't trust the ingredients used to be fresh. These are also times when businesses have to cut corners to survive and where would a restaurant cut corners? In the ingredients. With the free movements in get supply also highly constrained, I would also assume that the meat supply to be not so fresh. If a restaurant doesn't have a high turnaround then it's fair to expect the food to be stale. In this case I would expect it to be the same. Corona wouldn't spread but you wouldn't want a bad case of giardia or typhoid as well. Order them and reheat the food for a minute just to be safe How safe is it to order meat from these restaurants? I'm craving to eat some chicken or mutton or beef. But worried about stale meat.

Inb4 comments saying the virus doesn't spread through meat - yes. I know that. I'm only worried about stale meat since I'm not sure from where the restaurants are buying. It would be safe but just take extra precautions.
Also, if you have groceries and utensils try to learn some basic recipes. [deleted] I am here living on boiled rice for meals and roasted ground nuts for breakfast EVERY DAY.  Restored to use different spices every day just to make the same thing fresh.  My entire joint are annoyed with this and they want vegetables,meat and fish. The food package may have been touched by atleast 3-4 people so it's better not to order anything for a 2 months or smthng if possible buy some slice bread, bananas, peanut butter, rice and dhal

add some peanut butter to the maggi and try it with oatmeal also

also add banana to oatmeal

make banana, peanut butter, sandwich

if you got a pressure cooker combine 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup rice, 1 cup dhal, and 6 cups filter water on low heat for about 1 hour To be extra safe, empty out the food into your containers, throw the disposable containers, wash your hands and reheat the food. Opt for contactless delivery. Or, you can ask delivery guy to leave for pack with your building security (if you have that option). You have to go down and pick it up. 

I have been ordering food for this entire lockdown. Paper surface is not conducive to virus spread. Just make sure you tip delivery guy generously. 50 is norm. It's safe if you follow the following precautions. After you take the packet, take the food out on a clean plate. Then put the food in the microwave for 2 minutes. Throw away the packets while the food is heating, then wash your hands properly. 

Don't order online if you are not going to able to heat the food at home Just don't come in contact with delivery person and if you have gloves wear them while taking the order take food out as soon as possible and throw the containers."

> New Delhi:

> From videos advising people not to follow social distancing rules to those suggesting Muslims are immune to coronavirus, the Delhi Police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the government's efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic.

> In an investigation of the content being shared on WhatsApp and apps like TikTok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown, the Delhi Police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the Muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders.

> An analysis of more than 30,000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in Hindi and Urdu for a specific audience, the police said.

> The videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers, fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by NDTV. According to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.

> ""Several of these videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in India,"" the 22-page report, which the Delhi Police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.

> ""Our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising Muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill Muslims,"" a senior police official said.

> According to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.

> ""While analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,"" he said.

> ""Considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,"" the report says.

> According to the investigation, Chinese-owned video sharing app TikTok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus. These videos are further being shared on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter.

> Videos of Muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same, the report says.

> Religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown, it adds.

> Authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in Madhya Pradesh's Indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in Delhi because of a gathering held by a Muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country.

> In the investigation into the Delhi congregation, the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group Tablighi Jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as ""a conspiracy to keep Muslims away from fellow Muslims"".

> Since then, Maulana Saad Kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease.

> ""We have to take precautions, follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places. This is not against the principles of Islam,"" he said.

> While at around 2,000 cases and 53 deaths, the spread of coronavirus in India is far more limited than in Europe and the US, health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes root. https://www.altnews.in/old-unrelated-video-shared-as-muslims-licking-utensils-to-spread-coronavirus-infection/

From the article :


>On searching Google with the keywords ‘Muslims licking plates’, we came across the same video on Vimeo, uploaded on 31 July 2018 by a user called Asghar Vasanwala. According to the description of the video, the people seen in the video are Dawoodi Bohras, who are licking the utensils in an attempt to follow their belief of zero wastage of food


>Furthermore, the website of the Dawoodi Bohras states that they follow a tradition of eating meals on a steel ‘thaal’, which is designed to accommodate a group of 8 or 9 people. They also strictly follow a policy of no wastage of food - “Bohras have a no-wastage policy so not a single morsel should be left on the thaal when it is taken away”. Wait till those guys see the water used in Pani Puris ...Covid 19 is a virus that hopefully would be cured  .. Communal hatred  is deep-rooted in India  ..ain't no cure for that  shit .. A friend of mine who hasn't messaged me in months randomly sent me one of these videos and said take care, because of these people we will all get sick. We need to do something about them. Its utter bullshit. I'm a Brahmin Hindu, and I know my kin well--they'll find any germ- or health-related excuse they can to fuck over Muslims. Very important question. These could be staged, doctored or old, or it could be new and true. What's disturbing is that many people aren't interested in verifying the sources, and a question like yours assumes you support that kind of behavior and is in denial of ""the truth"". But given the extent of hatred and division across the country, it is the question to ask.

Delivery executive did not get assigned even after an hour so I thought I'll cancel. But their support is not available hence I just left it aside and had homemade lunch. To my surprise an hour later it got delivered so gonna have that at dinner I guess I ordered food on Zomato. The delivery guy called up to say that the police aren't allowing him to deliver.

Either I'll become super skinny or be dead by the end of this lockdown. Cops are retarded It's because the police of india will beat the shit out of everyone who's on the road, no questions asked.

We have enough money and the potential to be a developed country in a single generation.

But, somehow funds are released but ""never reach common man"" Call me a cynic but I don't believe this. I have no faith in Indians. We are so hollow as a society, this is just another opportunity for people at ration to scam poor people.

Most of the free food will be sold to rich people in black market especially with super markets not as easily accessible with lockdown. But Sir, Champani Retail was allowed to buy onion for 5 rupees per kg and sell it for 150 rupees per kg, when their stocks got over, government pitched in and reduced onion's price.

Chaddichandan/tadipar/champani/jumlabaaz gangs never let any opportunity to loot billion Indians go waste be it demonetization, be it aadhaar scam, be it corona virus But most of it rots in godowns or gets nibbled by rats Isi din ke liye toh FCI ne stock karke rakha tha saara khaana!

Food,So this happened with my food delivery,28,fuw9ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuw9ha/so_this_happened_with_my_food_delivery/,12,1586045402.0,"Today I ordered some food from swiggy. Order status was showing Delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by 10-15 min so I called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in 2 min my apartment gate. I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion. 

What do you think of it guys ?

TLDR : Order got delivered late, I suspect food was taken away, No confirmation of order deliverey, had to cancel myself despite receiving package. Got refund but feel something is fishy.",chaha-pohe," I would say please don't place the accusation with Swiggy unless you're 100% sure the delivery executive did something fishy.  
I had my Zomato order delayed last week, app showed him at the same place for a long time. Was getting annoyed because the Pizza would go cold and the restaurant was hardly 5 minutes away. When I called him he said he was delivering double orders due to the lock down. When I probed further, he revealed that the other order was placed for one address, but the customer asked him to deliver to another which was far off. When the executive refused saying he'll be penalized for going off route, they insisted he come there and they'd pay him 30 or 40 bucks. Being the naive fellow he was, he's gone there for the money and guess what, they've given him 10 bucks. When he expressed his disappointment, they've attempted to assault him. He was pretty shaken up. I told him not to worry and come to my place. Tipped him well and I was even more sad because the guy was very young. I learnt not to act hastily without empathy. He was likely hoping that you cancel the order. 
I have also heard of people taking the order ans asking delivery guy to not mark it as delivered and instead cancelling the order. 
This I heard from a ex delivery guy. All safety standards down the toilet. Post on social media to raise awareness. had a similar incident yesterday, where the app showed that the order was delivered when it wasn't.

reported it and got a refund. It's possible that police may be stopping the delivery guys at every barricade ??"
Food,Uber sells India food business to rival Zomato to cut losses,1388,ero2qq,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/uber-sells-india-food-business-to-rival-zomato-to-cut-losses-11579571079412.html,190,1579602723.0,,ppatra," uber eats was really really cheap for me compared to swiggy when i calculated bill in both apps from same restaurant swiggy was rs 400 or something ubereats was rs 280ish it had 50% off everytime lol They are discontinuing the UberEats app in India [according to their mail.](https://i.imgur.com/rGfsUP7.png), funnily they sent mail yesterday for their new [upi payment](https://i.imgur.com/tMHxeR2.png) feature.

Homepage on the app is also being [redirected to Zomato](https://i.imgur.com/aNR6irw.png).

Zomato is giving 50% off on next three orders and 3 months Zomato Gold trial if you click on ""Go to Zomato"" from [UberEats app.](https://i.imgur.com/WtfGw3H.png) (Thanks to u/JPBabuaFromOttawa) This sucks because Uber Eats is the only service that never messed up my order and always gave me a refund when they were at fault.

I at least will continue not ordering from Zomato. I've had delivery drivers literally go missing with my food, or they'll give me a completely wrong order, and then refuse to refund anything. Worst of all, if this happens after midnight, other places in my area close down and the only thing I'll get to have for dinner that day is a dozen servings of ""Sorry sir, apologies for the inconvenience.""

It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does it really sucks and they're incredibly unhelpful. I've paid for 2 or 3 orders worth 500+ bucks where I never saw the food before I stopped using Zomato except for Gold when eating out. Aye, This breaks my heart!

I was loyal customer of Uber eats since like start of 2018! At least in my area Uber eats was the best. 

Good offers, timely delivery and great customer service!

Godspeed Uber Eats, You will be missed... 😭 Sucks for international travelers who would only have Uber on their phones Uber Eats was better than Zomato  . 

They had better offers , better delivery, better service 

Zomato is still a lil clumpy and I don't think this is good for consumers as it can result in Monopoly...

Lets hope Swiggy ups the game fuck man! Uber eats was my favourite with all the discounts! Zomato is the worst! now only Swiggy remains

RIP 19 rs orders, 39 rs orders, 59 rs orders.. will miss them! Going to miss those outrageous discounts compared to zomato and swiggy Hope the employees and delivery guys are not fired. RIP Uber Eats. For me, it was always  Uber Eats> Swiggy> Zomato They're giving 3 months of Zomato Gold and Discount codes for 3 orders.

Pretty good deal IMO Ubereats was a saving grace for me back in college when it had just begun in Chennai. Guess all the undercuts bit them in their ass Well, this paves a much cleaner way for Amazon to enter the market and if that happens, Zomato would be their first kill in my opinion.
 Zomato has horrendous customer service while Amazon has one of the best ( in my opinion) Uber Eats failed to read the Indian market in food delivery. 

They focused on app design rather than adding more quality restaurants. I liked to use their app but it simply never had as many options as Swiggy or Zomato. 

For now, Swiggy remains to be the best app for food delivery. Bummer for me because I always felt customer service was better in Uber eats.

Also gave great offers which I think might have led to losses and ultimately the sale to Zomato This is sad! I ordered twice from Ubereats yesterday. Didn't know this would happen when I woke up. :/ My last Uber Eats order was just day before yesterday, they had massive subway offers all the time, overall their offers were much better and extremely professional when it came to delivery and handling, but I'd agree 80% of my orders were from swiggy and zomato. There were a few exclusive places in UE which I used order from because of offers and quality food. I guess those listings would get merged now. Oh crap Ubereats was really good and cheap compared to both rivals. I walk to the restaurant. That way, you'll get your order faster in Bangalore. So now the final war is between swiggy and Zomato? Zomato offers are nothing but adjustment and rounding off This is happening everywhere in the world. Deliveroo recently closed down in Germany, selling everything to the last remaining competition Lieferando, one of the shittiest delivery services. 

At least you have 2 options in India. Some places have only one! this i one news that has zero impact to me. i neither have ubereats, nor zomato, nor swiggy. i feel that these apps exploit the producers of food and are causing a lot of damage to the restaurant industry. i prefer to visit a restaurant, talk to the owner/staff, get to know then and i enjoy my meal more than an order in. This is why the free market sucks. Duopoly now and the customer gets screwed Thanks Uber eats for the memories Khana khau ki bc apps download karu? Zomato ate uber eats Man, this sucks. Uber Eats had great offers and seemed affordable compared to the other two. Also, their customer service was miles ahead of others, at least for me. Zomato still owes me ₹130 I think. Pretty weird why they did it. It was a dead company. The user base was overlapping. For 3 50 million dollars, they have not acquired anything ground breaking. Its just waste of precious money. It will be duopoly as it is other sectors too. More discounts on the way! Very bad Uber bhuko ka sasta sahara Investors - wait for the dip and buy $UBER. They got 10% stake in swiggy and zomato from a loss making segment which now also means more customers to swiggy and zomato. Does it mean uber ears will not be a part of my uber app? Zomato eats Uber Eats! I'm sticking to my pledge to never order cooked food from such apps. I either cook my food or go out for a nice dinner at a restaurant. Not gonna get into the habit of outsourcing 'cooking' food for myself. Quick question: Why was it an all-stock transaction and not a cash or partially cash transaction?
 I mean, imo, cash transaction is better than all-stock transaction in terms of operational freedom and profit sharing. Remember Letsbuy guys? Softbank pressure all around All these complaints against zomato are very surprising to me. I have never used Uber Eats and I believe you all who are saying good things. But zomato never messed up any order, and their delivery guys are pretty good. I always go back & forth between zomato & swiggy and choose the one giving a better deal. Swiggy has given me 1 or 2 mess ups but zomato never. F

Wish they sold it to Swiggy atleast. RIP uber eats This is why you go eat then & there, problem solved!
Just gotta use those at night sometimes tho."
Food,How do I politely turn down food in India?,22,fr02ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr02ak/how_do_i_politely_turn_down_food_in_india/,18,1585485942.0,"Hey Reddit!

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",keylimepie1123," ""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phrase Feel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one.  It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended. 

Hope this helps! Tell them you are allergic to  carbs and vegetable oil. 

big chunk of options  will be taken off the shelf . One trick that works for me is: say you are full well before you are. They will push to eat some more, refuse it a couple of times and then have it :) Things not to do in life:

>Visit India when you are recovering from an eating disorder.

None of the advice people giving you on this sub will work when you are gonna see so much Delicious stuff and you would want to try each and every one of those. 

> How can I politely refuse food if I am full? 

You start saying ""I'm full"" when you have eaten 50% of what you want to eat! Just say ""Ewww"" at hit the hand holding the plate. ^/s Just say that you are stuffed and mentioned that you loved it. Usually works. I don’t smoke so whenever somebody offers or forces me a cigarette, I say “I just had one before coming here” haha Simple and short. Stay drama free. Put your foot down and say ""No, THANK YOU!""

Stay drama free and simple. Repeat
Say ""No, Thank You"" Arre nahi aunty pet bhar gaya aur nahi kha sakhti 

Sach main aunty pet full ho gaya. 


Isse teen chaar bar bol dijye. Tell them you or on a fast. Simple as that  just ask for a glass of water when they offer food

It works out for me Just say 'pehle aap lijiye'. Just say that you had a very late previous meal. For eg, if you're invited over dinner, tell them that you had a very late lunch. nahi chahiye ji. any karl rock fans up in this bitch?"

Saharanpur police investigated the claims about members of Tablighi Jamaat defecating in the open when they weren’t served non-veg food as per their demands. The police found the report to be untrue. Why so much hate!!! Wait they did not defecate at all or they did not defecate because they were not given non veg foot ? Which one?
Food,This is a picture of Reliance’s Corporate Parks food court,343,ex2g8d,https://i.redd.it/j0c6b2xci9e41.jpg,148,1580569804.0,,sinsandtonic," I am an employee at Reliance and I have been harassed multiple times for bringing chicken or fish in my lunch box. Employers have no business monitoring their employees tiffin boxes. 
[It started way back in 2013.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naazneenkarmali/2013/12/16/mukesh-ambanis-reliance-retail-chickens-out-turns-vegetarian/#29b88bf548df) TCS Bangalore does not serve non veg in its food courts. Funnily only in Bangalore offices for some reason I work in Anil's reliance's campus in Navi Mumbai for a client company. It is the same there. You cannot eat non veg on your desk either. People still eat non veg in campus though but you have to be careful not be seen by security. There is a hospital in Bandra, Mumbai frequented by celebs which doesn’t allow staff or patients to bring non-veg food inside. The security opens staff’s (esp nurses) lunch boxes and inspects your food! The restaurants and canteens inside are obviously ‘pure’ veg. Lmao, reminds of the time in elementary school when my classmates used to bully me for bringing chicken nuggets on Tuesdays. I worked in a school where majority Gujaratis sent their kids. One of the Koli (fishing community) kids used to be badly bullied and left alone for lunch because she brought chicken. She used to cry everyday. When I told the principal about this and how we should be teaching children acceptance she said that the parents would stop donating and pull kids out of the school so they couldn’t do anything. I ate lunch with that girl almost everyday instead. India hasn't moved on from the 1800's, it seems. No eggs? Brahminism and capitalism are best friends Corporate -Hindu Nexus is the rot of this country All weworks are veg too. Why no objection to that?

Ref:

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/13/wework-meat-events-expense-ban [deleted] It's private place. They have all rights to frame such rules.
Think of those minority like Jains or others who don't eat non-veg. It causes them be discomfort sitting in same area where non-veg is served or is being eaten. This is fine with me.  I guess the rest of the food court is strictly non-veg. Vegetarianism is obviously the right choice, but it still has to be a 'choice'. Dhokla Dhokla everywhere I'm about to join Reliance corporate park . Can I PM you for some questions please ? BJP ka vote yahaan gintey nahi hai, Thokey jaatey hain! From what I heard from employees in Reliance Jio, there are dedicated inspectors who roam in the building to check if anybody is eating nonveg. And they've even fired some ppl, solely for this reason! It is also worth mentioning that they didn’t give a holiday on Christmas. I don't care what you eat at home but in my premises I will absolutely enforce food regulations. Why? Because it's my property and there are smells I like and dislike.

As long as the shareholders of Reliance (or whichever subsidiary) agreed to this policy, I don't see anything wrong with it. Many employees must be dying due to malnutrition. So sad."

If nations with far advanced public and health infrastructures@ like Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran are rapidly moving towards a state of emergency (Italy has gone into total lockdown as of this morning) then Indians are sitting ducks for reasons you probably know better than me. I don’t want to raise panic, but I want to quietly prepare for the possibility of a massive outbreak. 

**How should I go about stockpiling food?** Frozen food and canned food are out of options as my region already gets frequent and overlong power cuts on normal days and the latter isn’t readily available. 

What items would you stock on that’d have a long shelf life? 


@ - Obviously talking about the appalling state of government hospitals in India and the general doctor to patient ratio",KenjanRozu," indian food is easiest to stock. buy rice, flour, pulses, potatoes etc. Umm, there won't be a lockout in India. If it breaks through, it breaks through. The virus has a very high infection rate and comparatively, low mortality rate. So, by the time the government realizes that this has gone out of hand, it will be irretrievably out of hand, lockout will cost more lives than the virus itself. &#x200B;

To start with

Stockpiling in Indian context(Hope It wont be necessary  ), not restricted to food 

\---------

Cash

Grains, flours and Pulses of choice (Uncooked)

Milk powder

Baby food (If there are babies at home)

Pet food

Drinking water or RO machine

Pickles , dried veggies

Ghee and Oil

Emergency medicines

Dry fruits

Nuts

Gas lamp

Fruit Juices Tropicana/paper boat/ Pulpy orange

Powerbanks

Any board games or indoor game equipment,

Predownload  Youtube /Netflix/ Amazon prime videos to keep one self entertained .

Perfumes and wet wipes if water problem is anticipated .

Handwash r/coronavirus has lots of info on this Buy lots of maggi if its available there easy to store and cook Medicines for next months are really important, they should be of highest priority as the active ingredients that are used in making those have stopped coming in from China. Prices will start shooting up if that does not get restored in another couple of weeks. Please don't Panicking is only gonna make it worse... It isn't that bad...

Food,Zomato guy questions my food choice. (Beef),623,eqtfll,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eqtfll/zomato_guy_questions_my_food_choice_beef/,194,1579448429.0,"I'm a keralite living in Bangalore.
Ordered beef fry from zomato last night and here's how the conversation panned out

Agent: Where are you from?
Me: Kerala.

Agent: oh no wonder you ordered beef. Do all you  kerala people eat beef?
Me: Not really but it's one of our favorite dish.

Agent: Are you a Christian?
Me: Hindu

Agent: Then why do you eat beef ? Dont you believe in God? How can you eat beef?
*was really taken aback by that question* 
Me: Umm it's very common I don't find anything wrong with that.

Agent: The other day I saw a kerala guy selling beef and he had photos of God in his shop. 
Me: hmmmmmm.


I then went home and ate the beef fry, ordering it again tonight. So good.",Beers_and_Cheers_," with the way things are right now, i'm surprised he didn't spit on your food and deliver it to you. I've only eaten beef this one time and it nearly killed me. 

The meat was nice, the lynchers on the other hand not so much. I'm a mostly-vegetarian Hindu who can eat meat if there is no veggie alternative, or if said alternative has been had three times in a row. There's only so much salad I can do. This isn't for moral reasons; not having grown up eating meat means that the taste and texture are still alien to me. But I defend the practice of meat eating to my conservative friends and family. I tell them to (a) stop being hypocritical and (b) learn about other Hindus in India. 

I point to their and their children's leather shoes and ask whether the cow voluntarily donated its skin, and whether it continued to live after they were well shod. 

I point to the fact that of the top six exporters of beef in the world, three are Hindus. What do they feel about it? 

Millions of Hindus visit the Kullu Dusshera festival, where animals are sacrificed and the meat is eaten as prasad. The head priest of the Hidimba temple does the sacrifice. 

Some of their favourite BJP politicians wear leather shoes, and some, such as Sangit Som (one of the most vicious anti-beef proponents) have owned meat-exporting companies. Overall, beef  exports have risen under the Modi regime. DM me your best place to order beef from For an average Keralite beef with beef is a cultural shock. Its also very strange when peope talk of steak as the go to beef dish. Jesus Christ That is why I don't feel comfortable ordering off Zomato or anywhere else cause I feel like they are quitely judging my food choice but then again I am wayy to lazy to make my own food 😂😂 so Zomato it is It's just ignorance. Imagine if you saw someone ordering something like an octopus. You would be surprised at it, not necessarily in a malicious way, but just because it's not common and is generally considered taboo. You're lucky that the guy wasn't more aggressive.

However, I think it's the responsibility of the companies to train their employees not to judge people or make comments about their choices. Was the Delivery person from Zomato or Jomato? 
If Zomato surprising, if Jomato then Bhaiyya checks out. I drink alcohol and almost every time I drink 'socially' somebody will ask/tell ""you are a muslim, you are not allowed to"". We are inherently nosy. Judgemental people, I don't see that changing any time soon. As long as nobody gets hurt , I am fine. Looks like this guy was genuinely curious, rather than judgemental and accusing.  If yes, you might have missed a golden opportunity to convert a *bhakt* into a normal human being. He needs to be educated on how people choices when it comes to food shouldn't be an issue 

For education  is something that fight against ignorance Isn't basically all beef in India buffalo meat? I never understood this business. I've been having beef in India all my life, but I've never seen ""cow meat"" being sold. It's been always buffalo meat. I can't say that it's true for entire country. But the chances of cow meat in India being sold is still pretty low. Should have asked him, why they are selling it. I also cooked beef today and I am a Brahmin from WB. Beef Pasanda Zindabaad! Get this delivery guy's name and tweet this conversation to Zomato senior management. Even if they dont hold an enquiry, it will stop other delivery fellows from nosing into the habits of their customers. The shaming and violence aspect comes from casteism. This is completely different from the choice based vegan movement in the west. Hi. I am part of Zomato's marketing team. Can you please share the order ID with me so that the concerned team can look into this at the earliest? Thanks. Don't yOu bELive iN gOd???? You should report him to Zomato. It's not his job to question your food choices Freedom of food. I don't mean this in a condescending way but why should the delivery people even know what you're ordering? That's your and restaurant's business. we indians are too much worried about others Nepal is quite a Hindu country as well. Nepalese/Hindus eat beef like crazy, not cow though. I just don't happen to understand us, the Hindus of India. Be careful bro. Better go to a restaurant and eat rather than getting it delivered by brainwashed Sanghis. Just call customer care and get him fired. So now u got beef with zomato. Yesn't. Fuck them. This kind of stuff reduces my belief in ..religions. What you did was wrong and you should not do that again. Instead, eat the beef in front of the delivery boy. r/ThatHappened TIL people converse with zomato guys. You need to report this. This shouldn't be encouraged. Post it on Twitter or something. This is not something to be encouraged. The poison is spreading fast. I hope you raised a complaint against the scumbag. Which restaurant? I want to buy it. From where did you order? I mean people should realise it’s possible to be Hindu and eat beef! Beef eating was a well-kept secret and none of my extended family knows. Even now when I live in a different country I keep it a secret around my Indian (Hindu) friends because they are religious and won't be able to handle it. u/Beers_and_Cheers_ Report him to Zomato if they do have such an option. Its absolutely none of his fucking business to talk to customers about their food & this should not be encouraged. That idiot might even assault future customers. Be very careful about ordering Beef online. I remember that during the Gujarat riots these attackers had a list of people who were seen around beef stores in the old city. They attacked any beef eater. Please avoid ordering beef online. OP, what are good beef places to order from in Bangalore? send the email transcript to the ceo? People like him need some training You didn't offer him a bite? that's bad :D Why do I feel this story was written like the way r/indianpeoplequora posts are? Vegetarians, vegans and Hindu fanatics don't understand the freedom of choice. Like bro its my choice to consume what I want you shouldn't poke your nose in it.

Likewise its the cattle farmers decision whether to sell its meat or sell milk or use it for farming or whatever other uses the animal provides. Next time ask for a discount because you are a Hindu ordering beef 


:) r/thathappened I'm pretty conflicted about the beef issue

On the one hand I'm all for freedom of choice. At the same time, I'm under no delusion that eating beef - or any other meat - is a benevolent act.

Eating beef becomes even more problematic when you consider the environmental impact of raising beef cattle

I really don't know what side to go with this issue. Freedom or environmental benevolence? Screenshot pls... Am regular user of Zomato, never had to chat to any ""agent"" I don’t think that was bad, he was just curious might help open his mind as long as he was aggressive or threatening. It's your food choice and you are free to eat what ever. However, from an environmental perspective eating beef is a poor choice, because you know the belching that a cow and water buffalo produces and all that methane causes green house effect. As an atheist and vegetarian I am okay with people eating beef as long as they don't mind people eating dog meat . Sounds soooo fake, but ok Screenshot or it didn't happen."

* Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
* place fried fish
* use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
* garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:

Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

* Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
* peel off any remaining skin
* pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
* You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture. That looks fantastic! It's got me in the mood for a second lunch Rice looks a bit overcooked or is it broken rice? I've never heard of using peanut as a coating but I do love peanut chutney. Thanks for the idea! Looks like KFF I think you had too much water in rice while cooking Not a huge fan of fried fish (why make a healthy thing unhealthy), but this looks good. Why bro...why?? Please don't post beautiful pictures of food. I'm dying of frustration (and hunger too). Kon hai ye MasterChef? Kyun post karte ho aisi dishes jo main sapne me bhi na bana paun? Looks so delicious.  

Would omit the oregano myself, but it appears you've used it judiciously. We have beef!!! Whats the point, the fish isn't deboned. This is really a sight for sore eyes in this sub. That aside, I love the colours."

Here is a list of things you should stock up in case you need to cook. 

1- The list of spices 

Garam masala, Dhaniya powder, jeera powder(optional), sabji masala, Kali mirch powder (you can also buy whole kali mirch), Haldi powder, red chilli powder, garlic paste.

2) Oils-  Mustard oil, refined oil, ghee and butter.

3) Rice, pulses (moong, arhar and chana), wheat, besan, suji, dosa batter. 

4) Canned foods like Jam, peanut butter, mayonnaise, cheese. 

5) Eggs

6) Buy powder milk like everyday or tetra pack of Amul milk if you enjoy tea. 

7) Vegetables like onion, garlic, potato, sweet potato, tomato,reddish, Shimla mirch can last for sometime but keep them in open container. 

8) Apart from noodles also buy macroni and pasta. Smith and Jones pasta masala is good.

9) Fruits like orange, apple and pomegranate can last a few week.

10) sugar, you can also buy ""gud"" or ""misri"" which can be use as alternate. 

I have little knowledge about other places food so keep adding to the list. Go to a good YT channel and learn how to cook because even if this shit don't last long, cooking is an important life skill.",ppccbba," Another point, do not eat too much if all you going to do is watch TV or read papers. How does milk powder work? You mix it in water and you get something similar to milk? So much Chakhna and No Alcohol? Good Samaritan. Good list but I disagree with Smith And Jones part."
Food,Excess stocks of the Food Corporation of India must be released to the poor --Jean Dreze writes: Releasing food is all the more crucial as the emergency cash transfers proposed by the finance minister are likely to have severe limitations.,28,fxnlyd,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/coronavirus-lockdown-food-for-poor-migrants-mass-exodus-jean-dreze-6353790/,5,1586444092.0,,vv4life," They did not release rotting food grains stored on railway platforms to the poor even after the Supreme Court request, now would they ? FCI is a crap dump of useless govt chutias and babus. One person I know was a manager at FCI and ran a restaurant side by side. You know where the grains came from. 

Besides, it is stupid to have an MSP for grain and rice, and nothing for the crores of vegetable, fruit and pulses growers. It is criminal. 

I am not usually a supporter of privatization, but this is a PSU that needs to go ASAP. Give it to companies like BigBasket or Swiggy. They'll do a better job at a cheaper rate and create more jobs.

Food,Australians trapped in India's coronavirus lockdown fear running out of food and water,68,fr2jnq,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/australians-trapped-in-indias-coronavirus-lockdown-fear-running-out-of-food-and-water,4,1585498617.0,,ShortTesla_Rekt5," I have no sympathy for them when they are not more disadvantaged than an average Indian. 

But an average Indian currently in Australia is much worse off than an aussie. 

While many less wealthy countries are doing the right thing, Australia is doing its best not to look after the temporary residents saying that they are only visa holders. So government has no responsibility. 

In contrast to this, all foreigners in Portugal with pending applications will be treated as permanent residents from Monday until at least July 1, this ensures migrants have access to public services during the corona virus outbreak. 

Applicants including asylum seekers need only provide evidence of an ongoing request to qualify, granting them access to the national health service, welfare benefits, etc. Temporary residents in Australia are not even covered by national health insurance scheme and beleive me many don't have health insurance. 


Our own temporary visa holders in Australia won't be getting any benefit from their government. While Aussie citizens and PR holders will be entitled to receive benefits, many people on visas even those who pay the same amount of tax and are as disadvantaged by the situation, will now be asked to fend for themselves.

Meanwhile when it affects their own citizens all the rules go out of the window, for example recently Australian government allowed all international students to work unlimited hours as opposed to normally allowed 20 hours a week, as long as they are working in supermarkets stocking shelves for Aussies.

I am hearing news from smaller towns and cities for example Adelaide, where some Indian groceries are helping students giving free rations as many have lost their casual jobs.

On top of that, many people who came to India on bridging visas which has condition to return back within 3 months, Australian government has placed travel restrictions for 6 months, yes it only applied to temporary visas. Doesn't matter if you are living there from last 5-10 years. 

Now these people are stuck in India and many have lost their dream of getting residency, what's worse is they can't even go back to settle their affairs and sell their belongings, say their goodbyes. The government refuses to extend the deadline on their entry due to no fault of their own because they are visa holders and not Australians.

I can go on and on with the list........."

Updating as he's speaking

1. Consider this as a curfew - Modi
2. This will be a 3-week lockdown...
3. As per experts -If we are not able to control it in 3 weeks, we will have to pay a huge price for this.
4. 1 infected guy can infect hundreds in less than a week as per the experts and initially, you won't be able to detect any symptoms.
5. Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.
6. From their experience we can learn that there is only one way to cope with this Virus, We have to stay at home ""no matter what happens"", Practice Social Distancing.
7. Don't cross that Laxman-Rekha, break the chain.
8. Our current actions will decide the fate of our country.
9. ""Jaan hai toh Jahan hai""

11. Pray and appreciate the efforts of those Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors who are working for us and sanitizing our localities.
12. Appreciate the efforts of the security forces who are away from their families and they have to deal with our rude behavior sometimes.
13. WHO, Medical experts are guiding us and the Central Government is taking appropriate steps to cope with this issue.
14. INR 15,000 Crore allocated to improve our medical infrastructure.

20. Please follow all the rules and guidelines given out by WHO and Central Government.

\--End of Speech-- (Now correcting if I put anything wrong here, although I'm sure I didn't miss anything)

Tl:DR

1. Social distancing is the only way to fight this.
2. 21 days will decide our fate.
3. Whole country under Lockdown (consider it a curfew only) until 14th April (21 days)
4. ALL ESSENTIAL SERVICES WILL REMAIN FUNCTIONAL. [deleted] Actually appreciate what the government is doing. Lots of western countries with much better health care systems have been lax and look what has happened. Really regretting not getting my hair cut last weekend... Glad that India is taking seriously. Hopefully the government has contingency plans in place for daily wage labourers and others who can't survive without working. My father is undergoing second chemotherapy tomorrow, not sure what is happening.

Guys I am scared.

Edit: the main issue is no shops were open in Chandigarh, Mohali area where the medicine required for the chemo is being sold. They are not even answering the phones. We were hoping on tomorrow but now I am wondering if those medical stores will be open.

[These](https://i.imgur.com/WaWnKtE.jpg) are the two [medicines](https://i.imgur.com/1uvYI2K.jpg).


Edit 2: Had a call with one of the dealers, he says the shop (selling the required medicines, situated in Sector 11 Chandigarh) will be open by 0900 tomorrow. God bless this country especially the poor.

Edit 3: [UPDATE : March 25]

ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ

Yeah boys, we got the medicine today, though one of the salt iv solution were not available (from one brand).

Yesterday, one of the redditor in the oncology field advised to use the same medicine from a different brand.

Our doctor confirmed this too.

So we bought that medicine drug and everything went smooth from there on.

My mother and I are so relieved, thank you for so many replies, suggestions and support. You guys rock

Probably should mention the situation in Chandigarh, we did notice that people are rushing towards medical stores like every other general essential services and there were long queues of people there.

I do feel, proper system framework is required to enforce this curfew. My friend is undergoing Radiation therapy for her stage 3 cancer.   
I've been accompanying her to the hospital and back, have our own hired car.   
I hope this doesn't become an issue. If people weren't hoarding shit before, they sure as hell will now.

Needs to go into the nitty gritty. Everybody already gets the big picture. Just returned from market. Purchased medicines,veggies ,fruits. Thanks God How do ""Essential services will remain open"" and ""Total ban on stepping out, forget what going out meant"" go together? Even if the grocery stores are open, what is the procedure to go out?

There is an urgent need to clarify this. Its utterly chaotic around my neighbourhood. Which countries are dealing with coronavirus in the best way possible? Home ministry to give detailed report on the exemptions soon. Food? Vegetables? Medicine?

Edit:

>Letter from MHA regarding lock down and list of essential services.

Hope it clears all the doubts I might be agreeing with the man for the first time Will food delivery work? Exactly what steps are being done for essential services? I'm not stocked for 21 fucking days! Good speech. No theatrics. On point. Laid bare the threat, and announced strict but necessary measures. #Jaan hai toh jahaan hai Why didn't he say anything about groceries and medicines? That is literally the first thing I am worried about.

Edit : I saw PMs tweet. Wish he had said it in his speech. I am also skeptical as to how this is going to work. And  am hopeful it won’t be like demonetisation where there was no planning for implementation. Fingers crossed! DD News Live Link, rewind a bit to see PM Modi's Speech with English Subs

https://youtu.be/EaOsJRru-YQ Nice. He's saying don't listen to rumors and fake news. Only take meds that are approved by doctors. Hope these cow dung aficionados are listening to this. [deleted] Shouldn't we declare national emergency, so people can relax on bank emi's, rent, electricity bills etc. What does this mean? We can't go out for even essential services? Man, it feels good to be finally agreeing with our Prime Minister on something. I am not understanding what lockdown means, will we be able to buy Groceries and things like that because our current stock will last just 4 more days I think. If yes, then anyone could possibly walk around and say they are out to buy groceries.

Will there be any sort of punishment for those caught roaming freely? If yes, then on what basis ? Essential supplies are going to be available. [Please do not panic. Please.](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1242476408896507910?s=19) Hope people don't draw a line with lakshman rekha (pesticide) on their doors to keep the virus at bay from tomorrow. Who know we may see some WhatsApp message like the rohini nakshatra one. Good luck Indian friends, respect from Chile how do we get essentials now? big names like grofers/bigbasket are not delivering, we can't even go out. One thing I find disconcerting is the lack of transparency and finer details regarding a lot of things. There are no clear guidelines on how and when the people in isolation or quarantine are going to be tested/treated or discharged.

Then regarding the essential supplies. It's not clear what all is available and can be bought and from where. And what about the supplies from the government to the people who need it the most.

Hope there would be clarity regarding these things in the coming times. Dont panic and purchase a lot guys kirana shop and pharmacy and milk shop are always open My family has a seasonal business. This is gonna fuck shit up this year for us. Happened with GST and we were finally recovering this year. Fml. https://imgur.com/a/K23PvpJ

Detailed order.


P.s. It's a great read tbh. My Grandfather is bedridden and is on life support i need protein powder which won't available till tomorrow he can't eat on his own he will starve my god i am so scared they were run out in all the shops...

Also all veggies are sold on gaadi..so no veggies? i am confused and 3 week complete lockdown? food runs out what then? what happens if some building water supply breaks..?

Also people don't really care about social distancing no one is following it fuck this could be it. I'm all up for this, but what do I do about pet supplies? I need cat litter for my cats.

Edit: What's with thr downvotes, I'm genuinely asking. What if someone's pet needs food and stuff? This is a tricky situation. My dad is stuck in his posting. He can't come back home. He is alone and will have to manage everything himself now. Cooking and stuff. Hope he stays alright Lockdown has been initiated. It's a thing we really needed and I'm glad that this shit will finally be taken seriously by people. I just hoped he would have been clear about the essential supplies as people are swarming to stores right now. They are scared, and I empathize with them because people get afraid. PM should have emphasized that people should not go out now. Now, because of the crowding, there will so many more people who will get infected. I expect cases to rise even more now, because of this.

Another thing that should be done ASAP is **educating the goddamn cops with what are essential goods and not to just laathi charge people going to buy vegetables or medicines.** Sure, beat the shit of people loitering or taking selfies of empty roads but for fucks sake, stop harassing people who are out buying essentials. An acquaintance of mine was not only hit by cops but was given a lecture as to why he didn't stock up on vegetables earlier. Do these dense idiots not realize vegetables don't last very long?

Also, please don't forget your pets. Buy food for them when you're picking up supplies for yourself.

I hope we get through this. Best of luck everyone. Goodbye guys. It was nice knowing you all. Finally!!! Now that this has started, I want to ask how can we help the poorest of the people in the country. People who earn 100-200 rupees per day and will go hungry or be under huge amount of debt if they can't work for a few days. Are there any NGOs we can donate to that can help such people with food and essentials during these times. 

Lock down will have to continue past April 15 for the virus to be completely contained but a very good start. Let's take it one step at a time. If people cooperate and the state provides the hospitals with enough medical supplies, we can come out of this pretty come summer. Fingers crossed. I wish he had emphasised in his speech that essential services would remain open. People went beserk and started rushing out and hoarding food to prepare for the lockdown which was unnecessary  Yesterday, I commented on this thread that I am having to go to the hospital during this lockdown on weekdays. My friend (from Nodia, WB) is presently living with us (Kolkata, WB) for her Stage 3 cancer treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital, New Town, Kolkata. Her radiation will be going on for 28 days, Monday to Friday.

We have hired a car. We carry papers and ID (including patient ID) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. Today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. He stated the reason why he was there. The cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

This is anarchy.

I am not on social media other than Reddit and I do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. However, I would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. They are not communicating at all. We are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted. I do not think that the police have orders to beat up anyone they wish to.

I would also like you all to warn others. And if you or any person you know is presently deployed to police the roads during the lockdown, kindly let us know what rules/instructions you have. Because today, it seemed like you have none. Nagma from ndtv just said that their studio is already getting pictures of people gathering in numbers and panic buying groceries. Shit is fucked up. Does this mean people will scramble to shops between now at midnight?

If doing it for hoarding, these four hours might do more damage. Let's hope this doesn't gets extended beyond 21 days [deleted] * There is a huge population of India which is dependent on day to day daily wages to survive . A 21 day lockdown pretty much screws them over badly . Now ,  I know many state governments have announced relief measures and central government is going to continue MGNREGA , but we all know the track record of the governments with their welfare schemes , especially in such a short time period .


* There is also a significant population of India who have been at the receiving end of this government's discriminatory policies . Many of them have 0 trust in the government ( I am not making a moral judgement ,I am just stating a fact ) . 



* The government's track record with previous such moves hasn't been really good . Demonetization was a train wreck . Article 370 was similarly a train wreck . GST was a disaster despite years of preparation  . Now we are supposed to believe that the various government will effectively pull off all necessary arrangements for this lockdown in a matter of few days ?


* 21 days of lockdown won't defeat coronavirus . It will return with a vengeance . The only way of dealing with it is mass societal awareness and changing our behaviour permanently . This 21 days lockdown will be useless if it creates a false sense of security and people just go back to their old habits Petrol pumps in Pune have been closed for private vehicles since yesterday, even though they are covered under essential services during this lockdown. If groceries, milk and medicines are not available nearby, how is one supposed to travel? What if there is a health emergency and need for visiting hospitals? Other alternate modes of transport are already banned or stopped..and now we cannot even use our own vehicles?! This is fked up..and starting to feel as if the ‘cure’ is worse than the problem.This also gives an example of how local authorities (Collector, in this case) can override orders from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Much needed decision.
We need to break that process!!! [deleted] Banks also shut? People crowded the grocery shops nearby my place, I wanted to buy some stuffs but I noped out seeing the crowd. Probably will check tomorrow morning if any stock left in those shops. :/ Railway has been ordered to make beds for quarantine/hospitals work has begun. I don't have much to be tensed about this lockdown but I am thinking of the poor who depend on their daily wages to eat. It's a check mate move 
Only time will tell if it's for economic or  virus For three weeks. Honestly, I'm happy they're taking this so seriously. Now just tell his own party members to stop taking out fucking processions. Absolute genius. He’s just saved thousands of lives. He had the balls to do what Trump did not. 

He said - “I understand that the lockdown will have an economic impact, but right now my first priority is the lives of Indian citizens.” What happens to the poor? Needs immediate cash transfer so they can stock things. I'm afraid deaths due to hunger and poverty will cross Corona. My dad's a doctor and will need to travel. How can we ensure that he doesn't get hit by a danda? Today I've seen videos of police beating up people in cars, bikes even before asking them what they're doing out there. These videos are from the chowk just outside my house. I'm so scared for my dad right now, he's 60, there's the risk of the actual fucking coronavirus and then the police brutality going on. Medical professional here. The heathcare professionals who are supposed to look after you, the citizens, can only do what they can with the supplies they are given. Most of the doctors do not have masks or any protection equipment for themselves. Especially in govt. Hospitals. We have to buy our own. The hospital administrations of govt. hospitals are corrupted. They wouldn't equip the casuality sect. of the hospital properly in normal times but are trying to do better in these testing times. 

Please do your part and stay home. 

Lot of people are roaming recklessly on the streets. These are the same people who, when they get infected, would come to hospital and complain that they are not being treated like royalty. India is a country with 1 doctor for 1500 people. We do not have enough masks and ventilators available for a crisis. Please understand. 
People who are complaing about getting bored while staying home- think about all the people who do not have the same luxury as you - all the health care professionals, delivery people, police , army, DAILY WAGE WORKERS. Stop being a prick and thank your luck that you are not out there battling this. 

PLEASE DO YOUR PART AND STAY HOME. People here in Bengaluru (Kormangala) are swarming shops and grabbing on to anything they can find. Total fucking chaos here. I am just worried about the stray animals! I hope the Gov will feed them till the lockdown so no one gets out to feed them! This is a very essential move I support it completely! Where's my free pornhub subscription. This lockdown means nothing if we aren't testing extensively to find most, if not all, of the infected cases. And yet, people crowded markets today wanting to buy flowers and fruits to celebrate Ugadi. :( It's literally a Rest in Home or Rest in Peace situation. Wow no water supply as well. Govt. says don't die of Coronavirus, but hunger and thirst. Every mofo who labeled anyone a fear-monger for sounding the warning bells here on Reddit and elsewhere can go fuck themselves.

Sanity has prevailed. Thank god for that. Need to ration my essentials and consume less food. It's saying essential goods will be available, does that include groceries?? Govt listed E-Commerce under the list of exceptions, during the lockdown period, to deliver all essentials like food, medicine and groceries. 

But Amazon Pantry, Big basket, Swiggy stores, grofers, dunzo, etc have all stopped taking orders. 

Police are beating up delivery executives on roads. Ye madarchod HIV hi thik tha, jo pelta tha vo hi jelta tha 4 weeks from tonight here in NZ. Welcome fellow isolationists! [""Keep the laathi away, please don't beat the delivery boys"": K Ganesh, Promoter, BigBasket, Fresh Menu.](https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1242766640132919296) How insensitive can one get 🤬

These are difficult times & what he is carrying only essential supplies, right? 

Why should he be beaten black & blue like he is some criminal 😞

Indian police, you can do better. 

#Covid19Out #Lockdown21 #lockdown 

https://twitter.com/santoshspeed/status/1242819959387914241?s=19 Should have assured people on how essentials are gonna be delivered. I can be really fucking anti-modi but the actions the Modi government is taking to fight the coronavirus are really appreciable (apart from the clapping shit but again that can be excused as a way to encourage the doctors and make them feel good about it). So yeah I am kinda proud of India rn. [removed] No mention who the government is going to take care of the poor. Day labourers don't have savings to survive 21 days without work. If COVID-19 isn't going to kill them, starvation will. At the state level, other than Kerala and Delhi, no other state is stepping up. 

Is there any plan out there for the poor? Lmao when modi picked the poster up, he indirectly wanted to say that the country is full of a bunch of morons. bachho ki tarah samjhana padh raha hai inko. Sir, that's all okay. What about the people who depend on their daily wages? And about essential services? Homeless people? What are the daily wage workers gonna do man? This is necessary but I wonder what they'll eat? I shit you not, as soon as I heard complete lockdown from 12 AM I took my scooter and ran to the market. It was completely deserted, and the most famous grocery store of the entire fucking city had its shutter down, but was operating from insides, probably packing orders for people who sent them lists. I had to plead to him to give me 2kg almonds, which he did, and I sighed in relief. If we were gonna go on lockdown at 12, shouldn't he have preponed the address to say, morning? Given us time to stock up on food, medicines for 21 days. It’s fucking happening !!! Alexa play Dooriyan hai zaarori Anyone who's loved ones still have to go to work? How do you guys feel? My mom works in BSNL so she has to go and my dad is scared shitless that she might catch the virus. :/ So main question. How are we supposed to go out and get groceries? I know the shops will be open, but there's no guarantee that police won't lathi charge us even if we tell them we are going to buy groceries.   
Will online retail groceries still deliver? Heard that Reliance is going all out, does this apply to their grocery retail stores too? Will they assure us deliveries for the whole month? ALSO, This might happen in the coming days.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.ladbible.com/news/news-italian-leader-warns-police-with-flamethrowers-will-enforce-lockdown-20200324.amp.html And the people flocking to grocery stores as if there is no tomorrow, while possibly spreading the infection. When if this is what he intended, he's doing a bangup job! Bhai people are panic buying now, the whole point is dead BC sabko condoms free me baaton, population ka bhi dhyan rakh liyo bhai.. They should also put hold on rent, education loans and mortages. This could help a lot of people who work on the frontline. Why not the same thing can be said earlier like before noon or in afternoon.

Why does this guy chose 8 pm for every such announcement This shit is going to spread like wildfire through the slums of India. I think India is going to be have the largest death toll. So many humans packed butts to nuts. How can you get 1.3 billion people, many of whom are extremely poor and just scraping by day to day, comply? Will e-commerce like amazon and Flipkart be still working? no layer masks selling for 50rs.
3layers costing more
N95 unknown brands for 400rs.
I contacted employee of supermarket chains easyday+more and both said they have shut shops till 31st march. Shutters were down. No grocery shop opened. Saw crowd at one shop and the guy said he's selling products at his own risk. The same said by chemists. Thankfully chemist shops near govt. hospital showed much confidence in their operation. 

Shop owners are waiting for ""Pass"" from local jurisdiction to start operating legally. 

Right now Governments are spreading the virus by their no planned hasty moves. >Supporting a govt decision during crisis does not mean one should stop critical thinking process. A thought lockdown would lead to groupthink & thus sub-optimal decisions. So, indulge me as I pose some questions as to whether a 21 day lock-down is feasible or even desirable?

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1242779897384198144.html On TV, rickshaw drivers cycling home from Delhi to Bihar. That's about 1,000 km. Others are walking home. Homeless shelters are packed. 
And the govt has nothing to say, no plan.

https://twitter.com/samar11/status/1242823667664351232?s=19 THOUSANDS have collected at shelter homes where Delhi govt has directed cooked food be provided. Overcrowded, overwhelmed- shelters don’t have adequate ration & infrastructure. Govt needs to ensure cooked food distribution at all anganwadis & govt schools also #21daylockdown

https://twitter.com/AnjaliB_/status/1242777027763003393?s=19 Why he always does this, come 4-5 hours before midnight and does something that creates panic? Because of this, there are lines in front of ration shops.

But we all should appreciate what he did as it is good for us. 

We all should follow this.

All the best everyone for the next 21 days. For 21 days Making my youtube debut with how to gain 21kgs in 21 days. Thank you PM Saab. Guys, the pornhub logo has changed to stayhome-hub logo today... did anyone notice? Given the seriousness of coronavirus this might be required. The problem though is how do people get their essentials?

I have stopped going out of my house and ordering using bigbasket. But guess what, yesterday Karnataka implemented Sec. 144 and rumor is that Bigbasket delivery people were beaten by the police because they are not classified as essential service. So Bigbasket cancelled all the deliveries.

Couple of nearby grocery shops are slowly running out of items. Talking to them it seems that the wholesaler vehicles are not delivering items. No bread, no drinking water, no biscuits. Nothing being delivered.

Now PM comes online and just throws out 21 days lockdown without outlining the big problem - How are people going to get groceries? State governments will have guidelines is not good enough. He should outlined some steps.

People in my locality are in full on panic mode. People climbing over each other to get stuff giving a middle finger to social distancing. He is afraid of  ""if all religious people go away..who the hell will vote for me"". Am I the only one who thinks PM should have made this announcement a few days earlier? People could have used these few days to stock up and not create chaos. Instead, he gave the bartan/bhaanda speech and sent confusing signals about Govt action plan. You have to agree , when this man knows shit's serious , he can use that charisma expertly . Not his biggest fan but I really respect and appreciated his view and action on this serious matter . For 21 days! Big decision! Big balls But what about the bills? How are people living paycheque to paycheque supposed to pay bills? They should put a hold on that too I appreciate the nice picture ITCell rustled up using clipart. A delayed decision but a good one nevertheless.

Also, should have given a longer window instead of just 3-4 hours. This is exactly what happened during demo that sent everybody into a frenzy. People in my neighbourhood are out on the streets and panicking. 

A decision this big for a country of 1.3 billion should not have been taken at such a short notice. Why wasn't this announced today morning? I'm all for a lockdown and I appreciate the decision; the execution and timeliness—not so much. What a Royal mess.

This one night after the speech is enough to spread the virus far beyond control in India. Ok, he did almost everything properly.

Wasn't clear about essential services 🤦‍♂️ Guys I'm scared. We don't have rations to live for 21 days. Wtf are we supposed to do? This sucks for the daily wage labourers, everyone puts out a fruit/vegetable cart, momos stall and so on. Also for seasonal businesses. Can't do anything to earn money. Much needed, the people of this country don't take anything seriously if not forced. What about ecommerce services and the internet?

Ecommerce will single handedly reduce the load and stress on all the grocery stores and medical shops out there.

It will also SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE an insane amount of people from gathering together and also help them live peacefully inside of their homes knowing fully well that people can deliver them essential goods.

Another thing is the internet. The entire IT industry is dependent on this.

Refusing these classes of workers who are majorly contributing to this country's infrastructure is an absolute must. What about daily wage workers ? What about EMIs, rent and interest payments ? I am fucking scared! I stay away from my native. in fact 800kms. i stay with 3 more people but thought that everything will be closed just makes me feel sick already. Cant go out. 

&#x200B;

Can we still buy food/grocery etc from tomorrow?  I just stepped out to buy some fruits and saw long queue at all the open shops. Cant blame people if they're hoarding either since this is more of a fight or flight response. We have enough aata. We still going out to get some, in case someone in our extended circle needs in emergency. I like this initiative, it was necessary. However what hated like was there was no clarity over whether groceries/pharmacies will be open. The exemptions for lockdown will be same as an the day of janata curfew. 21 days to develop a habit #Don't forget about your pets!!

If you are stocking up on food for yourself then your dogs/cats/pets neeed food too!! Get pedigree/cat-food/pet supplies and their medicines too! Don't forget them!! What happens to dabbawalas? Will meal delivery services continue? should have done this since 15 but okay not too late yet Good to know I've got three books left to read. Nice little vacation to get over the backlog. Good decision and glad he talked in layman's language. Hope people understand the 21 years setback thing and take this seriously now. Minsitry of Home Affairs issued a guideline for essential services

Also does insurance companies come under essential services? [Lockdown Guidelines](https://imgur.com/a/Oy4ZN50), what's open and what's not."

A friend shared a tweet saying that animals caused Corona, and other diseases like HIV. They captioned it saying that none of this would have happened if the world was vegan. I'm like uh.... That's not how any of this works. https://www.fsai.ie/faq/coronavirus.html Viruses are not living, neither can they be dead. Terms like being killed wont apply to them. They should use terms like activated or primed and deactivated instead. 

Maybe the heat or dryness interferes with their ability to infect, denaturing viral surface proteins necessary for invasion into host cells. (all conjecture obviously)


I am most fascinated by the jumping genes/McClintock story I don't understand? If I have Covid-19 inside me, and I cook food (obviously there is a chance that I will breath on the food somehow), can I not temporarily put some strain on the food, which once eaten can pass the virus. In that way, is food not a vector (even if temporary)?? If it can pass through surfaces an infected person has touched why not food?"

Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life.",olivawDaneel," >drinking warm water or hot water

This is a myth. we are warm blooded animal.(Homeostasis) 

>milk with turmeric

turmeric has anti microbial property .

>About gargling.

Gargling works on a simple phenomenon i.e plasmolysis but do remember to add salt..otherwise gargling is useless.

>Vit C

Yes its good for immunity. But regular and gradual intake of VIt C helps in enhancing immunity. My dad isn't letting me keep water in the fridge.

Fuck these stupid fucking retarded ass WhatsApp forwards If digesting mucous by gastric juices could cure covid-19, then mucolytics would have been the first line therapy...


Nebuliser and mucolytics, bam SARS-CoV-2. Why not look at fact checking sites or reputable media sites before asking for verification of putrid WhatsApp claims? Each of these have been debunked multiple times.

Failing that, listen to the PM. This is not a time for home remedies.

(And this BS about cold foods is irritating. Common cold and influenza are caused by coronaviruses, which don’t give a s**t about what you’ve eaten. Dairy, though, can thicken your mucus which can cause problems when you have a cold.)

Edited: although the thickening effect is called out as false in many scientific papers, which point to an allergenic effect instead."

Consider it a placeholder.


Some replace it with cheap, some with thief, some as shallow. It's what they want to see, their biases.


It's not the act of stealing or getting fired, it's the act of doing something that goes against the common held belief (eg, why does a well paid guy have to steal?), that makes it Induan. 


The disproportionate risk we Indians like to take (eg, stake whole life to clear IAS, which is very unlikely) - this poor guy didn't need to steal, that's what gets people.


You know, it's all in how you perceive it. 


If you want a thought experiment about 'Indian' try replacing the 'well paid banker' aspect of this act with 'poor'. How do you think the comments of this thread would've changed had the act been committed by a poor Indian.

&#x200B;

I hope you don't mind me posting this here for some advice! I'm a teacher from Sydney, Australia and I've just started my own online business. I want to start building a customer base in India first because I have worked with a lot of Indian children here in Australia and I always have a very positive relationship with them and their families. I also feel that our countries have a good friendship!

&#x200B;

Anyway, my product is digital and subscription based and I'm trying to work out the best way to promote it to parents and schools in India. I'll keep it as vague as possible so it doesn't come across like a promotion here, but I haven't been able to find reliable answers to some questions in my research:  


1. Is 400 Rs per month a reasonable price for an online subscription? I want to make it affordable for as many families as possible.
2. What are the most effective forms of advertising to reach parents? I'm on a limited budget and putting a lot of my time into my products, so I want to make sure I'm choosing the right advertising channels.

Thank you all so much for reading my post and any insight you can offer :)",Harxan," It really depends on who your target audience is. Generally, the ones who prefer online education are tech-savvy, urban people and they should be able to shell out 400 rupees a month. But they'll probably form a minority, compared to the total number of students in India. Most of Indian students are in mid-sized to small towns, where 400 rupees is a big amount and parents would think twice before spending. [To give you an anecdote about spending, Spotify gives student memberships at 60 rupees a month, and all my urban friends think it's a really good deal, while a lot of my small town friends still prefer to pirate it for free.]


But at the same time if the product is worth it, Indian parents are a sucker for anything education related. But you'll have to work hard to establish that trust.  You can have a look at BYJU's - they do a lot of teaching online and they've gotten loads of funding.

Edit: I worked for a couple of years, volunteering and teaching kids mathematics and English. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. [deleted] Ask the parents of the children in Australia.

Much more profitable. What specifically your subscription offers? Sounds interesting!

I would like to get involved. Could trade in some awareness and skill for involvement. Sounds good?"

Business/Finance,I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,350,a5ewag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,114,1544618818.0,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that.",badger991," It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

If these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. 

The request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. 

In a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. 

These people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). 

Let's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. 

I hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.

The government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.

The movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   [deleted] A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. 

And to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. 

And on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I'm not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it's the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.

With all that said, it's still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it's not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that's troubling regarding his appointment. I'm supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.

As for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won't be surprised if they're to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we've seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.

This appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let's see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its ""pillars"" stripped 😑 He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It's election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.

RBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang's nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone 😂 Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he's an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he's the guy for the job at all, cause he's not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das's qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \>   Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit. 

I definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn't means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.

This guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn't doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI. "
Business/Finance,"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”",3,d931fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/,0,1569445691.0,"*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",howdy_rss,

Cross post from r/indian_academia as didn't get many replies there.",aadha_taklu," MA in Economics is a rich qualification for any MBA with specialization in Finance ... Business Analytics will diversify her knowledge (into Marketing) and Quantitative Finance will accentuate her MA degree ...

Business/Finance,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",389,fv9ifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,64,1586098195.0,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",ringtring," I would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of SDRMF is given. Some people were complaining that why Kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to Maharashtra. There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.

I think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination. You can give all the justification and 'due process' you want. We all know the *real* reason why Delhi got 0. >The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is  because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi  in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state.

Yes so Delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right? like NDRF or the PM relief fund. I'm sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with Delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco Leave all technicalities. Can someone tell me how is Delhi supposed to operate without this fund? Basically the question is why were these alternate mechanisms not used? Great post u/ringtring. Kejriwal has been moaning about not receiving funding to combat the crisis and this is a great post explaining why Delhi was not allocated funds.

Either Kejriwal does not know the reason (mentioned in the post) or is willingly not mentioning it to create a sense of bias against AAP by the centre. Either way, he needs to get his facts right. Nice research with Finance commission recommendations.

But the recommendations of the FC is ADVISORY and hence NOT BINDING on the govt. . So nothing like constitutional obligations. 

Also PM Cares has a lot of fund now so it can be used straight away ... so I feel the ball is in Central govt. court now to get funds for Delhi and put the end to this issue and not politicise by playing around. I think Kejriwal is all in his rights to ask for funds.

http://www.arthapedia.in/index.php?title=Finance_commission This just sounds like bullshit based on limited understanding on so many levels. Let me tell you a few reasons why this simply cannot be true:

1) Let's say the disaster was limited to Delhi. Would they still give money to everyone - all states but Delhi? Of course not, they would have given money only to Delhi in that case. It's truly absurd to think that the centre is restricted from handing out funds to Delhi government in case of an emergency.

2) The money may not come out of SDMF but could come out of any number of places including but definitely not limited to the PMNRF or PM CARES fund. If you are saying that it is simply not possible for centre to hand out money to Delhi government to deal with COVID-19, that's simply absurd.

3) Delhi is going to get money sooner or later of this doesn't get better. It's only a matter of time. And the question would be why were they not given the money sooner, like the other states. 

4) At the end of the day what matters is that money that comes to the Delhi government, not the  route that it follows. It's a job of the centre to figure out the route and they are definitely not ""helpless"" in not giving money to Delhi. If they wanted to, Delhi would have had the money by now. What nonsense. Let me get the timeline straight.

BJP 2014: Elect us Delhi, we will give you statehood.

BJP 2015: Elect us Delhi, we will give you statehood.

AAP 2015-2019: Give us statehood.

BJP: No.

AAP 2020: Give us money for tackling a pandemic like every other state.

BJP: Sorry, you are not a state.

Fuck off! We are going through a freaking pandemic right now....To hell with all the bureaucracy and politics about delhi not being a state..we all know the real reason why delhi didnt receive aid. Thanks for research. So it is more like. We will make sure everyone suffers as we did not win the election? Your accusation of judicial activism is severely misplaced.

> It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis

I wonder why the SC saw issues with how it has been setup.

The job of SC is to make sure than every citizen of the union gets treated equally. It is also to reign in on power excesses. The executive branch is already the most powerful branch of the three and we need SC to balance the structure. Do we know how much of that money did they allocate to each state?"
Business/Finance,Here's my side of the story as a small businessman,25,fw7gcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/,6,1586237386.0,"This is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",doomedbijnissman," i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy. this would protect you from any fall out as things aren't in your control. this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything, whether they are an employer or employee. also,  working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said, they don't pay enough attention to work; inefficiencies are high, there are leaks within the workflow process. the system is far from decent, let alone perfect. i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything else.

from one small bujiness man to another, let the dust settle. you cannot do anything now since nothing is in your control. talk to your vendors and customers. make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs. this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once you're aware of the issues you'll have to deal with once things open up.

you also have a lot of free time since there's no activity. work on yourself and your company now. look inwards. take assessment of your processes, see where you can improve workflow, focus on efficiency. with not much happening in the world, this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldn't get time otherwise when things are busy (without disrupting operations).

I would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you. you're only as good as your team. if you're taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations aren't affected, you're more likely helping him and not yourself. it isn't your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you're paying for.  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do. make some phone calls, talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices. you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work. this would iron out all the problems you're facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over.

feel free to DM. i love to talk to fellow businessmen :) I don't have any advice that would help you. I just wanna say, be strong. This too shall pass! Stay in there buddy, you're young and that fire will bring you out. Whatever happens, don't quit, Difficult times bro! Stay Strong! A few questions:

1. Is your inventory perishable?
2. Can't it be sold domestically?
3. Not sure if this question is even correct - is it possible to go into a hibernation mode and then restart the business when things are better?
4. Are your customers in a position to wait for things to improve and accept delayed deliveries? You sound like a survivor, dude! You'll Noah this one out, pukka! Bro code says, you and your friends will be fine!"
Business/Finance,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,5,fxmvof,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,11,1586440394.0,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

Can't afford groceries if the lockdown goes on for another month. Sure, suggest us to buy cheap properties. Fucking real estate assholes. To a hammer,every problem looks like it can be fixed by a nail. Fact of the matter is real estate is a bad investment in India. You may buy a house if you wish to live in it. However as an investment vehicle with pitiful rental yields of 2-3% due to over supply in most cities, it is a renter's market.

Buying land on the outskirts where the city will grow into is a much better investment compared to buying built real estate. REAL ESTATE SHOULE BE THE LAST THING one should be investing in , in the next 12-15 months.

1. Rental yields from a rented home would barely be enough to cover the EMI of a housing loan ( let alone act as a secondary source of income ) 
I'm




2. Houses are highly illiquid investments. With the kind of job losses predicted over the next 12-15 months , one needs or have a solid savings pool to be easily accessible. If there are no takers for your house , you will have virtually no  liquidity on hand to provide for emergency expenditures ( mom and dad falling ill, deferred jobs for your sons and daughters , layoffs for you etc ) 



3. Post corona,  the reverse migration that has happened will not see most migrants returning any time soon. Most villages are self sufficient and labor migrates for better opportunities to cities. There will be  scant opportunities  post corona recovery and labour shortages will not be accompanied by commensurate wage increase as real estate firms will not be able to afford higher project outflows for labour. 

So expect massive delays on projects that are under construction . 


A large number of real estate firms will wind up. Quite a few will be stuck in litigation . You money may be stuck and you may never even see an asset. 


We are going through a highly irregular time. This is not a good time for such stupid investment decisions 

PSA : Stay away from this wall of text put up by OP !!!!! 

Real estate is the last thing a smart man should be looking at for the next 15-24 months. 

Park your savings in easily liquifiable and safe investments for the time being. ( FDs and savings accounts and maybe a few blue chip stocks ) 


PLEASE DO NOT INVEST IN REAL ESTATE. OP SEEMS TO BE SOME DOUCHE TRYING TO SELL SNAKE OIL BEHIND A WALL OF TEXT!!"
Business/Finance,Oil slump? India will rather play dumb by raising prices,79,fiolca,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fiolca/oil_slump_india_will_rather_play_dumb_by_raising/,23,1584245186.0,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-2194742?pfrom=home-topstories

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",decipherseattle," They did the same thing in 2018, when crude oil prices fell, they increased taxes on petrol and diesel.

https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/policy/excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-to-give-big-boost-to-centres-revenue-kitty/article22723716.ece

It worked out really well for them, centre got a big boost in revenue, and no one seemed to have noticed or cared (going by the resounding victory in the 2019 general election). Since the strategy worked so well before, of course they will try it again. Chutiye hain, they are only trying to help out their financiers, corporate donors. The corporate tax cut was the worst decision in the last 6 months IMHO. 

Modi's legacy will be filled with pakoda logic when people study history. He has the same place in history as Tuglak. [deleted] Bhai aur to koi income hai nahi, petrol se hi kuch kama lene do central aur state govt ko yes but you are antinational and no one listens to people like you because hindu khatre main I always support higher taxes and prices on oil. we need to reduce our dependence on that shit. in addition, i want that extra money to be  put into alternative energy like solar and electric vehicles and in fighting the impact of climate change"

I already have a small team of content writers, who help me with my content needs.

Because of the increasing workload, I am looking to hire two or three freelance writers. Basically, you will be writing:

- News pieces

- Blogs

- Articles

- Social media posts

- Newsletters, etc


Currently, I am hiring writers for cryptocurrency, finance, business (B2B and B2C) and marketing niche. If you are a skilled wordsmith, but don't know how to craft compelling B2B articles, worry not, I will give you basic training. But for cryptocurrency-related projects, it's quintessential to have knowledge about the general crypto market, tokens, and blockchain technology. I prefer someone experienced, but it's not necessary if you know how to use words and grammar properly. If you know someone who fits these requirements, please let him/her pm me. 

Pay varies between Rs. 250 - 700 per article, depending on the niche and the length of the article. The rate will further go higher for long-form content.

No upper limit to how many posts you write. Payments made on a monthly basis.

Please fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3KVC1pGt5iopHo1luUDX9EkgguYX8Qn3iqU7R-WhLj29jNg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to apply.

Thanks",3Dpanda," Hey buddy, just want to point out that freelance content writers are getting paid more than that for 2-4k word articles about simple things that can be learnt by reading the first paragraph on wiki. You'll probably need to increase the pay if you're looking to hire people with specialized knowledge and niches. Your rates are way too low. I charge somewhere around 2-3 cents (US) per word for content, excluding images. Rs. 700/- per article (say 500 words) is laughably low, including research. I can earn that faster working for MNREGA!

I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

What do you guys feel? Thanks :D",fiftycabbages," >ISBF delhi

Lund college hai, ek Chota sa 7th floor hai bas. No fucking campus 

And fees is retardedly high. Students ki gaand maarte hai college mein. It's a strict school. Placements are quite good here though.  NMIMS would be the way to go in my opinion.  If you can go abroad, give it a try. 

Only, beware of the fact that one year master's programme from UK won't be recognised if you return to India.  Unless you are loaded don't go abroad for undergrad. Just not worth it. Study in India and go for Master's later. What's your current age? Acha ji. Well tbh I did my college around ten years ago, things have clearly changed since then.

2) Do go through the FAQs and Terms & Conditions of respective banks where you have ongoing EMIs.

3) If you are still confused, always a best choice to talk to the customer support.

4) If you are in good condition to pay the EMIs, pay them.

Do you have any plan for managing your finances?",filter_kaapi," We're a small engineering services provider of about 50 engineers. We have enough money to pay salary for 1 month. Maybe if we cut salaries by 50%, we can extend our cash to cover for 2 months, but this decision has not yet been taken as we're waiting for the government to say something. If this situation extends beyond 2 months, we may have to shut down our business and lay off our employees. Really hoping it doesn't come to that. Regardless, we may have to lay off few of our middle managers and low performers as the revenue forecast for FY21 is bleak.

On a different note, the government asking us to keep paying salaries is stupid. Money doesn't magically appear out of thin air. Maybe the big companies can do that, but certainly not us. This is supposed to be good time for business, I just burned through savings to prepare for this season. Having to pay lease and daily wage workers with out any work, screams a lot of production loss. I will be drowning in emi in starting of next month.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

Business/Finance,What the fuck is modi doing ?,4,fmob0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmob0d/what_the_fuck_is_modi_doing/,5,1584858280.0,"What the fuck is modi doing ? He's unfit to be leader of this country. 

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",UsualEducation," None of this is new. He has always been doing PR giri only. It is not so much modi as the voting public, and lack of competent opposition. Yatha praja, tatha raja. Public who voted for him knew this already. You can't counter idiots with logic. They will still support him. Yes no one is talking about it. But I've seen many documentaries about our economic condition (I'm no expert but I've heard what experts been saying). This bubble was building up by the time of Congress but Manmohan was very smart. True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst. Experts say normally it takes a decade to come out of this condition. That's why it is called lost decade.
Now it was before corona. Lol. Get ready to go into stone age guys. What can he do best ? He can charm the people to stay home. Most of his tv appearances in recent times have been very intense. I guess people take his words. 
What hurts me the most is where are the Ambani’s the Adanis the Virat Kohli’s the Dhoni’s the salmans the shahrukhs.  And the countless other billionaires of india.   They should come forward and donate money towards this epic fight against  Covid 19. Ghanta bajaao"

Keeping up /u/pollguard legacy and /r/India tradition. I present to you Mark My Word Thread of 2019.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

Don't need to verify OP,  I have faith on my looks! Fun fact: This is the 5th year of the Mark My Words Thread!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I predict 5 more. Alright. Before next Diwali, I will get out of the rut I'm in. 

Get my degree. Get in shape. Lose my virginity. Read some books. Get fluent in French. Get a decent job. 

I'm serious this time. 

Remind me! November 13th, 2020 [deleted] A resurgence in ""hindsight is 20/20"" type jokes. India will win >5 golds in Tokyo. I'll attend in person. I Will get one match on Tinder I would have definitely mastered the art of driving by next year Diwali, at least I hope I do. My digital marketing firm would be bigger than what it is right now and I'd get to buy/rent an office space I'll lose atleast 10kgs of weight. I would lose 15 more kilos. Would prolly work at my own or some friend's startup. I will still have no girlfriend Oxeam3 will not lose his virginity - Mark my words till 2025. I will get a job and a girlfriend next year I predict there well be at least as many false prediction as last year.

(only me so surprised so less predictions was actually true ? xD) By next Diwali, 


I will get an Internship at a good product based company or startup.


I will become a badass bald guy with an upper body like Frank Medrano's and legs like Ronaldo's. Katega I will either switch job or start preparing for UPSC


Rohit Sharma will become Indian Cricket Team's captain


Tik tok users will surpass WhatsApp users TATA will be most affected company due to economic slowdown, might decide to shut down since segments of Tata Motors.      
       
Amazon/Flipkart will be under radar of govt. Thanks to Mota Bhai, bcoz Reliance will launch e-commerce platform.     
       
Saurav Ganguly will join BJP.      
      
NRC purview will increase to multiple states. ""AAP will win Delhi 2020 election""
But I'm a NOTA supporters I'll get 99+ %ile in CAT in the coming year. Mark my words. Mark my word for 2020 -

* ""India will be superpower in 2020"" as predicted by our lovely ex-president APJ Abdul Kalam Sir. We are successfully failed in it.
2. India will make good efforts to promote electric vehicles and in green energy field.
3. Jio will start exploiting users like Airtel and Vodafone.
4. Recession will hit hard.
5. Government will close down or create problems in major PSUs.
6. MS Dhoni will retire from Cricket. I will become the main subject of a conspiracy theory. Going to get a much needed surgery.  
  
I'm going to finally move out of my parents home and get a job that's better than any of my batchmates. I'll hit the gym from next month and gain 10 Kgs. I won’t see Diwali 2020. Just a feeling.... I will do sincere efforts to improve my life I will be same next year.. Big Fat Bald Loser.. Rupee will hit new low of 85 to 1$ Priyanka chopra and nick whoever breaking up next year India will lift the WT20 2020.

I will finally get a decent job with good pay for sure.

I will fulfill my family's dreams. I will kill myself finally * Digital rights go further down the toilet, with blatant abuse of laws to ban whatever the government doesn’t want us talking about. 

* An marked shift towards Russian/Chinese style of surveillance; an attack on the intelligentsia. The government will manufacture excuses to extract details of donors to organisations/think tanks that oppose the national dialogue

* The blur between advertorials and actual news becomes so fine that people are exposed to propaganda non stop and don’t know it. This leads to an increased level of background casual racism that becomes more and more accepted. 

* BJP goes after opposition via Tax Man and the opposition eats itself like the fox from the Antichrist film and there is nothing left to oppose Modi-Shah

* Modi’s star wanes while Shahs rises. There is no major power struggle, but the writing becomes clear on the wall. 

* Water scarcity problem becomes dire and erratic weather wreaks havoc state by state, month by month. People become desensitised to the madness and uninstall PhonePe when it suggests for the umpteenth time to donate to CM flood disaster fund. 

* Internationally, nations become stricter with their immigration processes and increasing competition makes economic migration near impossible. Brain drain decreases, but in a market where cow piss research has more funding from Centre than biotech research, they are unable to contribute in a meaningful manner. 

* Amitabh Bachan dies. 

* I come out of the closet to my family, but they assume something is wrong with me. 

* Everything must burn in order to rise from the ashes. I will become superfit and get an arm tattoo. Definitely! Reduction in use of plastic and reduction in pollution. I will have a girlfriend (hope she says yes mah dudes) 

I will finally stop procrastinating and start studying again and get back my form

I will overcome my illness 

I will finally stop highlighting every sentence of my book because I don’t get what I’m reading. (Most important of all) I'll be doing an internship in summer 2020 and will have a job by Diwali 2020.

Good enough situation for PS5 I will get a job offer.       
I will learn French, at least this year properly.      
Récession will hit and it will hit hard. Will finally get serious about UPSC,  would have forgotten about Priyanka (or back with her). By next Diwali, I will have figured out this adulting business. I'll also have made up my mind about which path to take: MS in US, In India via GATE, or work at a top product co. in India. BJP won't lose any election except maybe in Delhi.

One major ""investment"" project by ambani. Next one year will be very decisive atleast for me, as far as my personal as well as professional life is concerned. Decisions made now are going to shape the life, maybe the whole life. Marriage, relocation to another country or coming back to my parents to take care of them. I will have to be a lot smarter to see things ahead to avoid any fuckalls in future. Life has been pretty chill in last decade except for one or two fuckups/accidents. I got over them pretty quickly but now things are looking worrisome.

Business/Finance,Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,119,dwnioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,43,1573833074.0,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. 


**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?",Vibgyor_5," Get a trusted relative or a close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father. I mean get someone who is true well-wisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to. Your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community. 

I don't think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings .

If he was so concerned about kids , he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school. Just make sure he doesn't start contacting any European women while he's at it. I don't understand this! You dad wants to start a school? Or does he want to teach?

Each of them are very different adventures! * Have you tried to find out what is motivating him to start the school? 
* Show him some examples of the ""risk"" associated with running a play school. Especially the legal risk (that could be deterrent to some).
* Assume he doesn't have other fall-back options (financial) for his own care/ medical expenses, then highlight that too.
* Considering that your Father has had considerable expertise in some field in the Govt sector, why not redirect him to a start a consulting firm in his core area of expertise? There are still area where experience matters, especially in Govt sector.. Don't support him financially right now, because you'll just be enabling him. Besides when he goes broke, you'll be one who they turn to. Show him Mota Bhais photo To be honest it sounds like he won't listen to you. I would suggest:


1) try to talk to him using numbers, charts, as someone suggested

2) speak to your brothers, get them to understand the financial risk, and get them to commit to supporting your dad when he loses all his savings

3) when the above don't work, speak sternly to your dad. Tell him you'll limit the money you'll give him when he burns through his. Prepare for everyone to get pissed off at you.


Unfortunately it's your financial future at stake. Everyone is going to throw kulcha in your face. Be prepared for this to become a big stink, and for him to lose all his money and for you to have to support him for the rest of his life anyway. But at least you would have tried, and can tell him and your siblings you told them so when they ask you to give up 40% of your income looking after him. If your dad wants to open a professional school,take him to see how one functions.After govt job in UP,he may have very different expectations of how work happens.Seeing a functioning one would give him context and feel for the entire project,instead of stubbornly dithering in the dark.  
If your dad just wants prestige he thinks he deserves cause of govt job,but didnt get after retirement,and is trying to manufacture said by throwing money around,abandon ship. He has to come to terms with fact that the time to throw money around has passed. I can think of two things. Either convince your dad or reduce his liquidity.

Your mother tried to talk with him? What is her stand? Can she convince your father to put at least some money in her name in non flexible instruments like NSC, PPF or tax free bonds, gold, small peice of land?

Would it be helpful to visit to a financial counselor who can point out how little 15- 25 lakh is to spend retired life?

Would it be a good idea to convince him to be associated with an educational institute for a couple of years and learn tricks of the trade?

Would he be willing to be associated with a NGO that works in field of education?

Can you try to talk to engage him with other people who tried education business but failed?

If everything fails, I think you should make it very clear that you will not support him financially. Whether you do so or not is a choice that you can make in future. 

Tread carefully on this last one. It will surely break his heart. You also risk to loose inheritance. I am just hoping that this will give him a shock and may be he will consider what he is doing. Ask him to take up full time/part-time teaching job in some govt school. No risk, impart knowledge, earn some pocket change and keeps him occupied. Let him burn it and when he is dependable on you, ruin his life witb many ""I told you so's"".

On a serious note, play school is not a very good venture to put your money in currently and its gonna br very hard to push towards profit and needs a lot of effort. So slowly do some research and shift it in your dads house buy out a share and be a 50% partner, talk like a businessman and tell him now you would handle it.

Then hire that coordinator and just give your dad a share and tell him to relax.

But make sure someone your dad listens to passes on all this to him, your dad seems to be one of those people who never listen to their kids. This is a general issue with Indian parents. They raise children as investments and expect returns from them when the children become capable (else you get labelled as 'nalayak' or 'kamini aulaad' by the society). They don't care about saving for the future, or about how they'll get money when it runs out, since you're always going to be there when things get hard. It's one of the pitfalls of a closely-knit rather than individualistic culture (but that's the discussion for another day).

I and my brother are going to be very set financially. I have an awesome job with amazing pay and my brother is in a very good college and is generally pretty good at what he does. However, I already warned my parents to not see us as investments which will generate returns and rather save for your retirement. I'm still going to help them if things get bad, but it won't be because they managed money poorly. As a result, they've started saving and investing money for themselves and aren't speculating real estate anymore.

I think you also need to do the same. Ask him how does he think he'll survive once his saving runs out. If he has a plan, good. If he doesn't, make it clear that you won't help as you've got your mouth full in a bad economy. MAKE THIS VERY, VERY CLEAR. He needs to be fucking adraid. If he still manages to get into a bad spot financially due to external factors, help him obviously. But this should stop him from squandering money.

If he wants to be nobel and wants to help, tell him to teach people at home for free or volunteer for free at a school or NGO nearby. There's a lot of help people can do with time rather than money. Why you do this op. Quit your job and help out your enterprising dad. You are lucky to have a dad who has this entrepreneurial spirit. Bc, you should help him reach his goal. This is the major problem with Indian society you don't support people who start a business. You need to help him attain this goal. 

A man at that age is having ambition is a rare occurrence. It's tells that he will have character and commitment. I don't understand why you judge that he won't succeed. You need to believe in him and his goal. He will do great , help him do great. 

As an entrepreneur this is my piece of mind"
Business/Finance,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",61,ee6xey,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/,28,1577061630.0,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe.",wricker," I really really appreciate what you had to say. We are screwed on so many fronts that I honestly believe CAA js a good facade for the government to keep people engaged. Good news is that people are coming out in large numbers. 
The anti-muslim, anti-dalit anti-anything that isn't savarna Hindu (that too a very very specific type) policy is dangerous and the govt will unfortunately carry it out via the front or the back door.
I have also learnt a good lesson now- no party should get absolute power. The federal structure of government was designed by our founding fathers for a very sound reason. This is beautifully written. Can't disagree with any of it. Do you believe all of this will end in a remotely democratic manner? As in bjp's removal through elections? Or is it likely all bloodbath and genocide from here on culminating in civil wars and perhaps even foreign interference. As much as I agree with the spirit of this post, I completely disagree with the substance - or rather, your interpretation of India.

This isn't about _ghar wapsi_ or about Modi or, indeed, the BJP (scum though they are). This is about the creation of India as a political entity since before 1947. You see, it's this bit:

> And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?


The Constitution is only valid so long as the people of the country choose to hold it as valid. Pieces of paper have no power or sovereignty, they derive sovereignty from the people. The people have chosen to reject the constitution, because here's the kicker - the constitution and India are, and have always been, an inherently instable construct. The ideas of a secular India has always been deeply antithetical precisely because India is _not_ a nation by any rational definition of a nation. India is a hastily cobbled-together post-colonial creation that validates itself solely by creating an enemy - first the British Empire (justifiably so) and then Pakistan (unjustifiable) and Bangladesh (horrendously cruel).

It is these chickens that are, today, coming home to roost, because India's latent Hindutva was incredible easy to exploit. It always existed, it just lacked someone to point it out. And now that people are told that their Hindutva is threatened, the only justification they have always given themselves for the existence of their nation is collapsing, and they will shred the institutions meant to keep democracy safe just to keep their Hindu project safe.

India should never happened - the country was a post-colonial error, Britain's final kick to south Asia, and pretending it could ever be a secular country was a mistake. Secular nations are built on tangible cultures and cultural beliefs with concrete identities, like European nations, or Indian states. India was always Hindutva, and Hindutva was always India - all it lacked was the spark to set fire to the hatred and xenophobia that always existed, because that hatred is what justifies India's existence.

Tear the Republic down and demand statehood for your state, which is currently subjugated by India and Indianness. Sovereignty derives from a mandate of people living in consensus, and India will never have consensus that isn't phony and manufactured. That is the only way you can guarantee a better future for those not particularly religiously inclined. The idea of a Nation is based on commonality of language&culture. We preach ""Unity in Diversity"" and at the same time we also preach others to be ""Indian First"". These 2 messages are contradictory, why do we have to forgo our cultural identities to be an ""Indian"" if being Indian is just embracing the diversity?   Therein lies the ***real*** problem, the so called National Politics is stuck in a time capsule of North Centric Post-Partition Hindu-Muslim conflict. There is no nuance or logic to this narrative, BJP considers Hindu Nation as a foregone conclusion based on Partition whereas the other side doesn't have any retort other than ""let's not be a Hindu Pakistan"".

Liberals have lost the ideological battle because they're living in their own little worlds where they imagine India to be something its not. Majority of Indians don't give a damn about Progressive liberal beliefs and are drawn towards Charismatic leaders who talk in platitudes. What is the alternative to Modi? RAGA? Secularism is a noble State policy but it cannot be the only basis for a Nation. The ONLY ideological challenge Hindutva currently faces is Nativism from states such as Tamil Nadu&Bengal. Assamese opposition to CAB is also the same phenomenon, Assamese speakers have fallen below 50% in their own state and they don't want to fall any lower than that. 

>Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution

Liberals have spent the better part of 70+ years deconstructing and pointing out all the flaws of Hinduism but have done little to no attempt at highlighting the GOOD aspects of Hinduism to create a positive liberal Hindu identity. BJP has exploited this Hindu Identity vacuum by claiming that they understand&respect the good aspects of Hinduism,  people who would've sided with Liberals now side with BJP because they ""respect"" Hinduism, however superficial it may be. You should read [this article](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/jyzFxtxjd2iGQPqA3mgOfN/Narendra-Modi-and-the-mystery-of-the-Hindu-Left.html) for more details. 

>Islamophobia

You're playing right into BJP's hands by using this term. BJP can&will use an UNO reverse card and label you as HinduPhobic.  **BottomLine:**You CANNOT defeat Hindu Identity politics by appealing to secularism&constitution ad nauseam.  You have to create a political Liberal Hindu identity in opposition to their bigoted one and market it to the masses. That is the only way i can see Hindutva going down. In summary:

1. BJP wants to change India into Hindu Rashtra
2. Muslims, Christians, Dalits and people who take the Constitution and secularism seriously will oppose that
3. Hence the BJP is hiding its intentions now; it has to change people's perceptions to normalize Hindutva even more than it is normalized currently
4. So how does it justify its fascism? By creating the conditions necessary for its justification
5. Muslims protesting in the streets will be portrayed as 'Pakistanis' or 'jihadis' who want India to become an Islamic state
6. Students will be seen as supporting Pakistan and jihadis, hence anti-nationals; they want to break India into pieces
7. Intellectuals are anti-nationals and urban Naxals, maybe even supporting China
8. Slurs such as these were merely slurs, not to be taken seriously, but now they'll become actual accusations (with perhaps legal, or extra-legal, consequences)
9. A conflict with Pakistan, or a very tangible fear of one, will help these slurs become real accusations
10. Thus BJP can justify further fascist policies like detention centres (which they deny now), and even unthinkable ones"

Business/Finance,GUYS I NEED HELP !!! Debt advice!!,18,dyxvph,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dyxvph/guys_i_need_help_debt_advice/,26,1574258905.0,"I don't know much about running a business.My father has mortgaged our house to finance his business and has taken out a loan close to a crore, to get it running. This has induced a lost of paranoia in the house as my mom thinks that she has been made the Co applicant in the loan and is afraid that if the business fails she will lose all her retirement benefits.   My father claims that she is not the co applicant since it's a mortgage loan and she signed in a paper where it said that she won't lay any claim to the property. I keep asking my dad to show her the papers but he bypasses it somehow and when I say that we will go and speak to the bank manager about this he says that it might affect his relationship with the bank and the loan might not get renewed and it means the end of his business. He has recently invested in two different business in the last 4 months which are yet to generate considerable profits. Now he is asking me to be a co applicant in 25 lakh rupees loan for another business which he says he will get back the money in a week. But you see before i step into this mess i want to know what is what and this time Im willing to trust only real figures and official papers. But i dont know how to. So the things I want to know.

1)What are the financial liabilities of my mom in relation to my dad's business?

2)How do i know a)The current state of my dad's business? b)How much debt has he incurred?

3) How effectively is the loan money is being used?

4) Financially what I'll be putting myself into by becoming the co applicant.",heretoaskquestio," First step before investing in any business, not just your Dads. 

Check the account books, This being India he would be keeping two books. One for official tax and the other to hide it. get access to both. If he does not have these details then please do not even invest a rupee.

After checking the books and doing your own analysis of revenue generated and expenses you should have a good idea what state your dads business is at. PLEASE DO THIS ANALYSIS FROM THE START OF THE BUSINESS TILL DATE. 

Second thing is to get a business plan. Tell your dad to provide a business plan, after all he is running the business. Again, if he does not have this dont Invest. 

Third and the most important rule, **NEVER GET INVOLVED IN BUSINESS VENTURES WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.** This is a risky place to be...

If your Dad has a Company/LLP, buy the MCA records of Profit & Loss & balance sheet to know where it stands.

I do not recommend you co-sign the loan till you view the old papers & the new papers. Slightly shady, but if you have access to your dad's phone, plus his PAN number, just generate a credit report from experian or CRIF. You will get all details of his credit transactions. If it's a sole proprietorship, is your dad liable for tax audits ? If yes then you can probably try getting his tax returns or opinion ( I knows it's hard without help of your dad) from his CA who did the tax audits for your father. 

If your father is not liable then your dad's business is a pretty small one try finding his PAN and login credentials to access the return he has filed to know the position. 

Tax returns and books of accounts don't really reflect the true position but it can show you the minimum value that a company is willing to pay tax on. May be off topic a bit,

Is there a way to know the loans taken by my father? Including CAR Loans etc."

Edit : I know its the nominal figure, but it is calculated on the basis of inflation target of 4 % which in turn depends on the success of RBI and Govt policy in reviving industrial growth in the country. 8% real growth is still a massive challenge and using an inflated figure to claim that fiscal deficit will be brought down to 3.3% of estimated gdp figure for 2019-20 still implies that the fiscal deficit will rise in rupee term.

Edit: at least the banking section is more on the ball. However I’m not sure how RBI power over NBFCs is going to fix it?

What It’s now time for our citizens duties! Is our duty to make sure we get the bang for our buck? 

Ok time for taxes.

Edit: Republican Party of India. Spend more, tax less, take on more debt, and reduce the fiscal deficit. 

Frankly, given the mess we have, even that contradictory plan is not bad. Government spending is now a major part of our teetering economy. At least that’s keeping the infra side of our economy thriving.

However someone has to pay, and with lower taxes, taking loans is the other option.

Why is the minister speaking like this is an election campaign? Is every budget like this? Economic survey showed that rajasthan which relaxed the draconian labor laws generated about 25% more jobs than other states.

The current labor laws force small scale companies to not hire more than 99 employees.

This is because, as soon as you reach 100 employees, a large number of government laws and regulations come into effect.

This has caused small companies to not have any incentive to increase in size and take advantage of scaling to reduce costs Wow their arms are going to break with all the patting their own backs.

Literally zero hard numbers so far. This is disappointing in its predictability. What time (IST) will it start? What all reforms are you expecting? I’m expecting this budget to be something exciting this time. Will sadhvi also contribute to Gandhipedia which the minister is taking about? Did I miss the memo about Lord Basaveshwara? Nhb ko last saal pura 100% govt kia. Fir dekha gaunutra se kaam nahi baan raha. Send it back to RBI This just in: Taxpayers are the elephant in the room Fiscal deficit of 3.3% is starting to get into the high territory.

During the NDA 1 tenure, vajpayee government had made it a law to bring down fiscal deficit to 2% in 1 decade.

However both Congress and bjp government have shat on it every year without showing any serious intent to cut deficit.

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth.

Business/Finance,"The impact of GST on invoicing, and thus on revenue and profit of organizations operating in India - exploring one of the factors impacting the economy right now",79,d4mq0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,46,1568593682.0,"tl;dr

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs - INR 3 Lakhs

Installation - INR 30K

Support - INR 90K

UP

Chairs - INR 10 Lakhs

Installation - INR 1 Lakh

Support - INR 3 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

I'll probably put a tl;dr later.",zaplinaki," That was a very enlightening read, thank you for the detailed explanations and examples!

So far, I'd only read handwavy statements like ""GST is a ""game-changer"""" from ivory tower economists, but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality. 

This line in particular surprised me:

>Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state.

It's fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client. I know it's too long. I wanted to do justice to the issue. I got tired of writing it lol but I've tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it. I know the formatting is fucked. I'll fix that later too. This is very good, even with the occasional oversimplification. You explained everything clearly.

Having to maintain GST registrations in multiple states (especially for service companies, where the service is usually delivered over the internet, without any goods moving from one state to another) is a huge pain.

One nation one tax my ass! Yeah, to add to all this:

1. If you raise an invoice, you have to pay GST the next month without fail whether you can collect the payment or not.
2. If you're an SME, you have to constantly track whether the seller is filing his sales so that you get input tax on purchases
3. Make stupid e-way bills every time you send material out of the state and make sure they are the same as invoice

Bureaucrats make these rules on paper and flowcharts without having the experience to earn a single rupee in their life and make us go through with all this bullshit. Someone is doing more work than our Finance Minister. My CA was telling me that the government has some new regulation in the works that you have to use the sarkari GST software to upload invoices on a daily basis. He said it hasn't been put into effect yet. But if he is right, that sounds like a disaster for traders Very informative post, this is the kind of posts that make reddit india worth browsing 👍 Thanks for listing this out. IMO GST is the single biggest reason behind the current economic slowdown. And what you have listed is one of the biggest reasons. Somehow the taxation and MCA rquirements have increased manifold under the Modi regime but they are not being called out in the newspapers anywhere. The left is busy labelling Modi whatnot but they arent willing to go into the details of what is actually wrong.

The problem is that the congress/left started out by calling Modi suit-boot ki sarkar. Now they cant even turn on their blame because in reality Modi government is all about more effective taxation as much as possible. ALL of the Modi govt initiatives - Demo, increased MCA compliance, GST, angel tax results in more and more taxation - what they dont get is that in the process of making taxation more effective they have dramatically increased compliance costs for most businessmen and this is negatively impact the economy. 

Modi govt is actually more leftists than the left would like to admit. And because Modi is doing these leftish shenanigans, the left is reduced to calling him names rather than criticise him on policy and specifics. I don't understand GST that well, but I used to run a company in the past (pre and post GST era). It's still running, but I've moved on. 

Whenever we had an out-of-state client, we used to raise an invoice with IGST, as opposed to CGST/SGST split for in-state clients. 

Wouldn't that simplify the invoicing?

Like, the head branch of Tata Motors in Mumbai raising a single invoice with IGST to the head branch of Pepperfry in Delhi? 

As mentioned earlier, I might have got this totally wrong, as I don't completely understand how GST works with large organizations operating in multiple states working with several vendors spread all over the country. Looks like an excellent saturday read. 
Thanks you very my good sir. Will go thru it later. Thanks so much /u/zaplinaki for making this post and taking the time to explain in all these details.

Would you be interested in cross-posting in /r/IndiaInvestments ? You just get charged IGST if company doesn't have a office/GST in the state of receipt of supply.

We receive goods from Haryana and pay 28% IGST on it. Me: What did feku do in 5yrs

For millennia, the uber rich have controlled the world. With access to better education, networking, medical, climate, resources, and technology, is it even fair for someone from a third world country or other developing nations to dream about achieving the kind of lifestyle that an average first world citizen takes for granted?

&#x200B;

Spending most of your childhood and early adulthood studying and training to land a middling job in a company is what is defined as success today. People want security and stability - something these companies seem to promise. Yet, there have been an incredible number of stories about people getting laid off for no other reason than the company hit a rough patch for once in several years. 

&#x200B;

And then there are startups, the latest in a list of Ponzi schemes designed to drain the finance out of people looking to make money. With scumbag CEOs who are able to raise funding based off of their networks from ivy league colleges (that their daddy paid a dear amount to get them into), who have absolutely no business acumen, giving themselves salaries in millions of dollars, while the wide eyed, naive poor people or immigrants who have worked hard their entire lives in the hopes of bettering their lifestyles struggle to pay rent till they are laid off, what are we even doing here? 

&#x200B;

Echo chambers are designed to consolidate like minded people into their own virtual spaces. With confirmation bias playing a significant role in hindering mental evolution, is it really a surprise that people are getting dumber by the day? For a society to be healthy and functional, different points of view must be at the very least - considered. But, when all you hear are cheers for your bigoted and backward views - it marks the end of higher thought.

The system is broken - and neither democracy nor socialism/communism is the answer. Dictatorship isn’t either. Just for clarity, violence and anger are not the answers either. The last 20 years have seen the kind of global change that our ancestors could never have imagined. Yet, our philosophies of governance have not evolved. Our constitutions are old, and our leaders are too far gone.

I guess its no one’s fault. Our evolution depends on survival of the fittest, be it in good way(work hard, knowledge,innovation) or bad way(corruption,political power), everyone has to adapt to these changes. You have to outsmart other beings,learn ,improvise and adapt. The more I learn about our govt the more I believe we are past the point of redemption. Bass bacho ka nam vikar rakhna Sorry, but I don't underatand what your point is.

Meant positive unit economics and profitability.,wildgoat," Any company that seeks VC money for growth focuses solely on scaling up because that's the whole point. Scaling up raises valuation that helps current investor cash out while attracting new investors. It's only after IPO do they think of making money.

There are tons of businesses that do not take the VC route and they make plenty of money. Zoho is definitely the poster child for these kinds of businesses. Wingify (VWO), as someone else pointed out is another.

I've heard that even Swiggy, even though they opted for VC money, had positive unit economics until recently when Zomato launched their 50% off on all shit offers. Startup is not an industry, it's a company in any industry which is just starting out, I could startup selling doorknobs tomorrow and be profitable the day after or never. 

If your question is any app/service/product developed in India making money? Then there are tons of examples, but wait, are you saying is the company making money or are the owners making any money? 

Flipkart for example is not profitable, but the owners made a fuckload of money. All the employees seem to be making a lot of money and all the stakeholders made money when Walmart brought it.

The question remains who is not making the monies though. Ever heard of Zoho ? B2B software startups are closer to profitability than B2C startups. Fredhdesk , wingify ,fusioncharts come to my mind. SAAS companies are doing well financially. Others are on permanent life support through investments. Bookmyshow is an example of positive unit economics in the B2C space For Ola you can read [this](http://economictimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/ola-starts-making-money-on-each-ride-inches-closer-to-profitability/articleshow/64955093.cms) for Zomato [this](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/zomato-scales-fy18-revenue-by-40-to-rs-466-cr-losses-fall-almost-73/65904498)

Business/Finance,Will India embrace blockchain?,2,e8as8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e8as8b/will_india_embrace_blockchain/,2,1575931297.0,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

I mean why the fuck you are going to implement system in centralized manner when blockchain is for decentralization.

For example, Land Record. Digitalization of Land Record can be done by any existing dbms system but few people want to implement using blockchain. I mean what purpose will bloclchain provide ?"

Helpful post Great post. I think you should make it a regular feature and rather than posting all your suggestions in one big post, make it a monthly or weekly post where you focus on 2-3 good podcasts.

I find a lot of my podcasts from your first category, and my app is filled with so many podcasts that sometimes I get stressed out that i'm not able to listen to them. Also I'm not able to do multiple stuff when listening to a podcast, any suggestions on that front? SynTalk is great too.

If you have an account there transfer online today or take out the cash tomorrow before they put a restriction of 1000 per month like PMC bank.

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments.",spider143," First of all to the effort you put in. Kudos. And you have rightly observed. However most of our educated class still believes that we are doing great. The situation is far too scary then being showcased. Sorry that bhakts downvoted your post. Your instances while valid, are the truth, and not propaganda. 

Hence not suited to the average Indian's media palate. #SAB CHANGA SI"

2. You have mentioned though, read up something about the Research process and statistics

Good luck and DM if you get through!

 Sit back, relax. Don’t try too hard. And don’t kiss ass. That shit works. They don’t expect you to know about research, because if you already knew it, what would they teach? :)

You mentioned finance & accounting as your focus area, the questions will be on what research you can do in that area. What’s your research area, why is it relevant to the business world?

For eg: let’s say you want to do a thesis in impact of AI on finance process and function - read up all you can about it. They don’t expect you to know everything about it, but enough to see that your interest in research isn’t fleeting. That’s what they want to see. 

Also, if you’ve been enrolled in a PhD program in a university, they would’ve taught you some courses in how to conduct research or research methods, use it without letting them on know that you know too much. 

Basically, why do you want to do a PhD and in what area and how that helps the business world in general. 

All the best!"

If your Mother **owns 50% of the company or even 1 share of the company,** ask her **not** to sign anything without a lawyer/CA/Person You Trust Present.

To change the Director, A CA/CS needs the persons letter (easily faked) and Digital Signature (occasionally kept with CA/CS). So your father can transfer the directorship.

DO BOTH, the E-Complaint & the registered Post part.

Now, the good news is that it is not possible to transfer shares without her signature!

Also, you can file a complaint with the Bank and MCA & ROC. You can send an email to the bank **right now. And  a formal letter later**  thru a lawyer/CA where the professional mentions that there is a dispute between the owners and that the company block all fund transfers.

Business/Finance,In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,13,czff99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/,3,1567596462.0,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",nosleepnomore," if you have the 'cover' of a reasonably relaxed job, use the time and space to acquire skills which are valuable in the market. Then use those to change / upgrade jobs. I leave it to you to decide what skills to acquire - too hard to give specific advice on the internet without knowing you / your circumstances in person.

Look for a confluence of personal interest (in acquiring a skill) and that  skill having high market value (people will pay you money for that skill).

Good Luck. Having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky, plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it going.

Moving to the West is almost always a good idea if you are qualified enough as they provide better opportunities, pay and lifestyle. Returning to India may not be of much financial benefit. Please cross post on r/Indian_academia if you don't get any replies here. Hope it works out for you buddy."

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this."
Business/Finance,Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways,76,beaonr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/beaonr/mourning_the_demise_of_jet_airways/,36,1555551597.0,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?",baawri_kathputli," Bought air sahara despite warning from experts, had to write off, resulting cash shortage. Also stress sector and unstable government policies. [deleted] Read this article

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

Always got middle seat empty on my sector.

Decently priced.

International circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...

In a race with air india, it was indeed good.

As for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.

After the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. 

Flew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees very average airline in terms of flying experience. I didn't see the point of paying extra compared to indigo/spicejet for the almost same service. I had a jet airways flight in the morning, now I have no idea if/when I will get my money back. What are my options? I booked it through PayTM. 

What's worse is that I HAD to be where I needed to be and ended up booking a much more expensive flight. Fucking sucks. Talking about YYZ-BOM sector, looks like I am down $4000 because Jet shut down.

Today has been an absolutely awful day because of that. :(

Edit: I had booked 3 family members on AMD-BOM-YYZ return trips and I don't think I'll ever see that money. I was even thinking getting business class for one of the tickets (my grandmother). That would've been another $2000 down lol. At least I have that going for me, which is nice 3 months ago I flew jet airways from Paris chennai and back to Paris. Worst flight, service experience for an international flight. At that time itself I complained to their customer service. Sorry to say this.  I’m glad they’re out of business. I’ve flown many international airlines and this was the worst of it all. Lost all my JP miles :("

The people losing there jobs are here people who earn on day to day basis(they are affected the most) along with the factory workers and even cut down in many well established companies . And the sad part is it's not over yet many more people to lose jobs after lockdown and even if things restore completely it will be very hard. A bigger dent is going to come in this economy which for sure can't be handled by the current policy makers(don't wanna politicise this) Because we have so much more population right now than what usa had during depression (or even right now too).

Coronavirus,So what are the superstitions or beliefs that your family has been following in these times of Coronavirus?,19,fxtdhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxtdhx/so_what_are_the_superstitions_or_beliefs_that/,13,1586471269.0,"We know various kinds of superstitions or *desi nuskhe* go around on Whatsapp and our family members happily laps them up. So what are some of these quirky beliefs that your family has been following these days to be protected from the coronavirus?

For example, in my family whenever we get anything from outside, like vegetables, fruits, groceries (in sealed packets), we wash them outside our house bringing them in. First we wash them with a solution of water and baking soda/salt and then keep them to dry in the sun for an hour or two. And then the person who went out to get the stuff(which is mostly me) has to immediately take a bath and wash the clothes as well.

[Here is todays stuff in the sun after being thoroughly washed.](https://imgur.com/a/mhoGdgZ)

I don't if this would work in keeping the virus away, but atleast it gives mental peace to my family. So we probably will keep doing it for the foreseeable future.

Share your stories.",tor17no," Taking a bath after coming home from buying groceries is actually a good practice. And so is washing fruits/vegetables. Although you don’t need to use baking soda. 

My family also has got to a tee disinfecting stuff we bought. There’s a designated contaminated zone where we dump the new stuff, disinfect it and then put it in where it needs to be. The entire process with vegetables (except baking soda) that you mentioned , I follow in normal times too. And during these times you must take a bath after coming from outside and wash your clothes immediately. These are sensible things to do.  So I am a little concerned for you, that you feel they are superstitions. ( Watch few blogs from people shopping in Wuhan during lockdown, to see what precautions they took) 

Do you notice how many people spit on roads, dig their nose and sneeze without covering? COVID-19 has a high viralload that means viable virus stays in air or fluids for longer time. So. Much. Homeopathy. 

Honestly, as long as they are practising social distancing, washing hands, and not going outside, they can eat all the sugar pills they want, I don't care. All Muslims are intentionally spreading coronavirus"

Government must ensure that all ceremonies which require people to gather together is banned till corona is defeated.

Come on, use Whatsapp/Hangout/Skype to attend ceremonies remotely. Religion le doobega duniya ko people attending their own shradh; strange times When Muslims were verbally abused and ashamed by all the media people why not this type of religious Hindus people be ashamed nationally or else inko lagega corona ne bhagwa pehna hai Hindu ko kuch nai hota puja chalu rakho Why religion is not in the title? Hindu Jihadis must be shot on sight.

/s Is this called shradh jihad now? There are many such religious clusters in India, shradh ceremony, vaishno devi, tablighi jamaat etc. The Jamaat incident is just one of them, you will obviously have a higher proportion of jamaat patients to the total corona patients if you only test them. Did we even consider that the other clusters can also have corona patients. All Jamaat people are being tested irrespective of whether they have symptoms or not, while normal people are tested only under strict guidelines, media houses as usual are busy making this into a communal issue, nobody even mentions the word sampling bias. which is what the jamaat incident is. What is shradh? Im sure modia will cover this with due diligence. Aaj Tak, Zee news, ABP news, India TV and Republic TV aren't covering this, why? But the most reliable sources on this very sub told me that all the idiots spreading the disease were from tablighi jamat... Only Tablighi Jamat’s Delhi event Is decorated in the TVs as the main cause of spread, hoping Sanghis will enjoy the deaths of the minorities. But what about shradh and many other Hindu ceremonies? What happened to them? Will they be tested?

If not tested, how do you ensure that the deaths caused were not due to COVID19? 

Is Indian administration hiding the real numbers by not testing enough or under reporting, like what US claims China did ? Let's see how the mainstream media covers this. What the heck is wrong with India and the virus? They refuse to stay inside they gather in large groups, assault medical staff and sexually harass female medical staff. IAS officers fucked up Bhopal totally. Some genius hid his travel history and conducted multiple reviews & meetings now entire health department is down. Elders must be respected in the group. What's this jihad called? Anyone? Upvote this to no end.  
Let's do our part in highlighting Godi Media's blatant Islamophobic hypocrisy.  
Let's also not try to turn this into a competition of which community contributed to more covid cases though. 

I feel sorry for both the Jamaat and the people who attended this event.   
Religion really does need to die as it'll kill us before our natural deaths. Considering this event occurred a few days before the lockdown, I'm guessing these people didn't know the severity of the situation. Same as Tablighi people who had already gathered before the announcement of lockdown. Correct me if I'm wrong pls. What I thought the number was more than 1500? No common sense at all ! Same like the jamaat international people meeting ! Why join together when corona virus kill people left and right !! How did we not get to know about this? 

Inb4 Intelligence Failure Killing it India 👍 keep up the good work May their souls Rest in Peace. 800 people attending a sradh ceremony ?
Then how many people were actually invited?

This must be a world record for maximum people invited for a sradh. So 800-12=800?  😲😕 Irony!!! Efforts of millions get wasted by a handful of idiots. Fucking morons need to be taught a lesson. He only went for checkup after it got worse.He was sick when he organized the event but he didn't care.It's been 

Government needs to ban all kind of mass gatherings religious or not.Problem is police is too overstretched in most of the places and are helpless in stopping such events .People get violent  very fast if you tell them to follow rules.

Guy I knew did not postpone his marriage reception even though he was advised against it by me during early days of lockdown,  police and local authorities got the news of event and the whole event got shutdown midway.I didn't go because that was the wise thing to do.People love to flout rules because that is the general Indian mentality, they consider it their birthright.

Your and your family's safety is  your own responsibility ,if you are  invited do not go , avoid crowd as much as you can and also do not organize such events too.

People need to be more responsible, blaming government for its inefficiency won't help.They are not omnipresent, they can only act after they get alerted. Was Bhopal under lockdown on 20th? This event took place on 20th of March. [deleted] Stupidity is on the rise.

As you can see most other countries have done about **thousands** of tests(USA 6291, Spain 7593, etc) except a few exceptions like brazil, who has done abut 258. Heck even pakistan seems to be at 191. I am worried about street cart vendors, daily wage labours, poor families.... it’s going to be a living hell for them. May God gives them help and courage. This moron will not move his fingers for help. Awesome get ready for another pointless, cringey national flashmob to entertain the chaddi pied piper. What about the poor people? How are they going to survive? More will die of hunger than corona itself. So strategy is gonna be to go in lockdown until a vaccine is found ? A young entrepreneur here.

Why can't he come out and say we are expecting x cases by 15th April, if we have more than that we need to have stricter lockdowns otherwise, we have a staggered opening up. 

Non of these decisions are based on data or logic but more on emotions You fucked up by not taking it seriously in Jan and Feb The key here is to test test like he said, and really thoughtful about situation here, bringing in some innovative solution. chutiye it was possible if you had done rapid mass testing. now you don't know what to reopen and what not to.

(1) Customer profile - How does it work? Can you explain in detail about it? Factors that affects customer profile. 

(2) Is it a score decided by software? Or you guys decide yourself when customer calls you and you check order history?

(3) Customer data - How much access do you have? Is it possible for someone to access user data without getting caught? How does Amazon handles this particular issue?

(4) What's the compassion for late delivery complaints? If delivery guy is responsible for late delivery, what happens to him? (Negative points, something like that??)

(5) Decisions- Do you have freedom to decide on your own(at least in some areas) or you just have to follow a script or rules all the time?  
  


(6) Customer behaviour - Some customers are very rude. How do you deal with that & How does it affect you?

(7) About your job- What are the factors that decides your performance? Do you have any targets? What's your promotion criteria? Do you think Amazon cares enough about customer care experience & representatives? What is the starting salary. I hear that they offer free launch. Is that true? Your office has pictures/statues of the bald billionaire? They give you incentives for working overtime during sales? Whenever I feel lonely, I troll call you guys. Can you forgive me? Also, please don't issue those warnings to me. I just want a friend. Throw light of some un-ehtical practices there. What was the weirdest conversation you've had with a customer?

edit: letters How does your Superiors treat you? Do you know what happens in the background when the last mile delivery folks fuck up? I know CS isn't responsible for what happens here but I'm hoping you have some insight. 

I've had far too many instances of these guys lying on the app as to why they couldn't deliver it to me on the day that it went ""out for delivery"". They also tend to never pick up the phone or promise to deliver one day even if they do but still end up postponing a day. 

For instance, the updated status at the end of a day will be ""Customer requested reschedule"", ""Customer not available"" etc. They are obviously lying because I often wfh if I know a package is expected.

FWIW, I live in the middle of Bangalore. Do those 'SORRY' or '50OFF' ""lifehacks"" ever work? Thanks for doing this  


* Isn't this outsourced to third parties most of the times? Why is amazon having a dedicated team for this? Or has this been the case due to quality being low from third parties. 
* Have you worked as a customer service associate before?
* Are you aware of companies which get outsourced support work, which companies then hire to do support work? Dumb question: Any history of CS associates jumping to a different career within Amazon itself? Like a project manager et al Does your address get blocked if you refuse to take delivery of products too many times?

My family orders a lot from Amazon. And we refuse delivery for around 5% orders [deleted] Do you have a daily quota for how many refunds you can issue? How often and regular are the promotion there in the CS team? 

Will an average employee who works as per his working hours, maybe once here or there does overtime, will they get promoted?

Are your working hours fixed? I meant is a 8 hr shift 8 hours or does it change too? If it changes, do they pay you more? What about shift timings? Do they keep on changing? 

How frequently do you get your leaves for vacation? How many are alloted to you?

The abuse Amazon gets for overworking the employees, is that true? Or is it just specific for warehouse employees? Hey when there is an issue with delivery during Black Friday. Like Shipping lost and the customer never received the item. What are the options you can offer to the customer when the discount is not available on the item anymore ? For example, 150$ difference on item price. 

&#x200B;

How much credit could you offer at Max ? 20 ? 50 ? 100 ? 

Could you offer a discount code on this item to match the price ?

Could you offer Amazon gift card to match the price ? 

&#x200B;

Thank you for your answer, What Qualifications do you need to be an Amazon CS guy? What is their interview process like? Are the offices spread out elsewhere in India or just Coimbatore? Is it illegal to share prime account by my friend who lives in the different city altogether?"

Not sure.
Recently one of families in my society came from Europe ( germany to be precise)
The commitee requested them to call someone from their relatives at their house so that they can be home quarantined and their daily necessities can be taken care of.

But they didn't obliged.

Commitee called police.

Police instructed society to keep a watchman 24 hours outside their house for 14 days. 

The family protested but then police told them if they didn't obliged they will taken to govt. Quarantine facility.

So yes , situation is scary. Pardon my ignorance but lockdown means, no movement in and out of city right? Within city ok ? From Mumbai ..have yet to come across any news related to the said Lockdown ..let's not fall victim to hearsay/ rumours .. believe it only if and when it comes out from the officials ...

Unverified,We need to extend support and solidarity to minorities and marginalized sections of society rather than vilify them if we want them to keep coming forward to report coronavirus symptoms,51,fv6zuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv6zuc/we_need_to_extend_support_and_solidarity_to/,11,1586085660.0,"We have all seen how Muslims are being vilified after [a Muslim congregation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52147260) sparked a new wave of COVID-19 cases.

Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

A BJP Health Minister himself [revealed the names, age and locality of Nizamuddin returnees](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/this-is-why-the-names-of-the-nizamuddin-returnees-who-tested-covid-19-positive-in-assam-were-revealed) who tested positive in his state in an official press conference. He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers. 

Similarly, by now we have all heard of [how 5000 migrant workers were sprayed with bleach](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-migrant-workers-sprayed-intl/index.html) to ""disninfect"" them.

Thankfully the identities of none of our covid 19 cases (neither Hindu or Muslim) have been leaked. Also anyone who gets infected is a patient who needs treatment from a highly infectious fast-spreading non-discriminating virus, not a terrorist or anti-national. COVID19 has wrecked havoc across the world and everywhere governments are trying to find hospital beds, ventilators, and medicines for the ill, and here in India we are trying to find who to blame. This jamaat gives media the opportunity to steer away attention from the stranded migrants situation, so this won't stop. Jamaat guys infecting others is a better headline than the hungry crying migrant family pic coz it shows administration in bad light Agreed. It's genuinely worrying to think about the number of cases that might pop out once this lockdown is over since there are so many people who need to be tested but aren't. Putting fear in people is only doing worse. I'm sure a lot of these people are scared that if they do come forward and end up testing positive, hell will break over them."

I heard from an unverified source that one patient was identified as CoVID-19 positive after death. (They're not testing people who are alive, why'd they be testing the dead ones. That's why unverified). But there is a possibility that many people are dying without being identified as a positive case. 

I was thinking, this could be debunked if we compare the number of deaths from month of Jan-March 2020 with average mortality rate in India in a month (if such data exist). But I'm unable to find any such database on government websites, maybe I don't know where to look for. 

If someone could guide me through it, I'd really appreciate the help. And if someone has already made this comparison then a source link would be helpful.",amzed_can," I don't know exact sources, but perhaps you should also try comparing pneumonia related deaths YoY. >why'd they be testing the dead ones.

Because if the person was positive then his history will be tracked because everyone who came in contact with him will also test positive!

>I was thinking, this could be debunked if we compare the number of  deaths from month of Jan-March 2020 with average mortality rate in India  in a month (if such data exist).

It's impossible to track that way, [34 births, 10 deaths are registered in India every min](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/34-births-10-deaths-are-registered-in-india-every-min/431650/)

You can't have access to this data as per my knowledge, rest anyone else might correct me if I'm wrong!

Do you just want to know the actual number of death? I can't help with that!

You wanna know how many positive patients are out there, 50k+ by rough estimate. I have not maintained any source link but I am studying all that data which comes out, the death, travel history, age, location, and that kinda stuff & then I compare with all that data coming from Italy and what happened in China.

P.S. feel free to guess a higher number than 50k+, I gave you the lowest. Quiet an observation. But if in India deaths are happening due to Covid-19 without getting counted in number of cases. Then such families would had come forward till now as symptoms are known to all and family members would also have been suffering from the same.
Highly unlikely to be hidden. yes it is correct that data disclosed by govt are restricted and limited .. there was a death last week in bilaspur, chhattisgarh state, published in local news paper, which is not shown anywhere in official covid19 record.. plus 4 families got home quarantined who came into contact with the deceased. That bastard Modi ain't gonna get nothing from hiding the numbers. So, why don't he start speaking the truth at least now? Lying ass motherfucker. Wouldn't work. For a population of India's size, you would need many thousands of extra deaths to be sure that those are statistically significant and not just normal year to year deviations. And if you really have many thousands of extra deaths then you wouldn't need to compare statistics for it to be obvious.

I think it is very likely that some deaths due to Covid-19 were missed due to lack of testing. It might even be in a few hundreds.  But, one, that has happened in pretty much every country, and not necessarily in an attempt to hide anything. And two, it is unlikely for it to be so much that it could be uncovered by comparing statistics from previous years. Do update us on your findings."

 Ha ha I wish there was a defamation case against everyone who called the Gandhi family corrupt. The entire country will be behind bars or spouting sorry and celebrating national apology day. Love how some people are celebrating this.

And those saying he used this to score brownie points during elections? Well I would anyday vote for this guy who calls a spade a spade. We all know how corrupt our politicians are and we all know that we could never prove it without getting vyapamed. Hell Salman Khan can file a defamation case against everyone who called him a killer and demand apologies! I hope AAPology letter will go to Delhi people also, they are suffering a lot.

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

Source

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

Link
 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.
Source:

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.
Source:.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

Gorkhas from Nepal will not have to worry about NRC because of CAB says Amit Shah.

But we need to do more. While educating common folks on CAA/NRC is important, we need to talk a lot more about the excessive police action taken in Jamia, the internet shutdowns, imposition of sec 144, situation in Kashmir, Northeast, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka etc. 

Also let them know that these protests are the only way a common Indian can make this government answerable for demonetization, increasing unemployment, poverty & income inequality, falling GDP and economy, environmental issues, mob lynchings, women issues and any other problems they face.

It is very easy to defend CAA, there is a team of BJP IT Cell working overtime doing exactly that, making info-graphics, creating whatsapp forwards etc. Engage them with showing videos of police brutality, and these are their standard replies:

1. ""there are 2 sides of argument"": Accept it, and then let them know that we're the ones showing them the other side; TV news, whatsapp forwards isn't showing you the videos you're showing them. Ask them, if there are 2 sides of the argument, why is government instructing TV news channels not to air news about the protests. [The circular](https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/1208048457249722368)

In this subsection you should mention the Assam exception as the rules are different for them. This is great work! Finally something objective and reliable! Hey.. I’m an Indian Muslim and the last 3 months in India have been a complete nightmare. I saw your post a while back and really appreciated the time you took to lay everything down with sources, easy to absorb. For a while I tried to get other people to read it too, but most people aren’t really readers, and not into politics either, especially if it doesn’t affect them directly. 

So it inspired me to create a YouTube video with sources, much like yours. I tried to keep it entertaining (without being inappropriate), and sprinkled it with pop culture memes and animations. So even if people weren’t politically inclined, they watched it. 

I couldn’t fit all your points into it, as it was too long. But I just wanted to extend my deepest gratitude for your post, as this is where the video really began.

1. Is everything normal as claimed by the govt.?
2. Are people happy now that 370 is no more ?

4. Will govt. compensate the loss that businesses are having due to snapping of internet ?

How do you feel the way Pandora are portrayed? Where do the minorities of Kashmir: Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs stand on the issue of independence or merger with pakistan? What’s your favourite color? Have you read the book Our Moon Has Blood Clots?

What's your opinion on it? Do Muslims threaten to kill you, rape your women unless they're willing to convert, and burn your houses? Or is that a lie spread by low-life BJP muthafuckas? Just got news from a friend in Jammu that Jammu is having a bandh to protest against snapping of internet and loss of business.

Is Kashmir also observing a bandh ? How would you feel like if Kashmir gets developed like other states, cities aka Concrete Jungle, factories etc.? You've mentioned the views of your community, and that of other communities, but tell me your personal views. Do you personally feel the removal of 370 was the right move? What is a pandit?

It’s bad enough that war carries with it the heavy losses that it does but uncorroborated news spreading faster than fire on news channels and social media is going to make this way worse.  republic says 'we stand with forces'

yet the one guy who was most effected by today has got the least coverage on your channel.  People on my family group are forwarding messages like ""in case of war, it can turn nuclear. Be prepared""

lmao be prepared with what? Patanjali ki cream se radiation marega kya?

Indian people haven't properly been educated about nuclear bombs. Most think it's like any other patakha ""Bharat ne chhuraaye Pakistan ke chhakke, shanti ki beek maang raha hai Pakistan""

This is the trash we are shown on TVs

Source: ABP News As an Indian living in the UK, it's so frustrating trying to figure out the truth of what actually took place. On India's side it's 'We killed 300 terrorists' while on Pakistan's side it's just memes about them missing and hitting trees.

Now India is claiming technical faults crashed a plane, and that India downed an F-16, while Pakistan claims they shot down 2 jets and captured 1 pilot.

Fucking sad seeing chest-thumping going on on both sides, and any questioning of the official narrative on both sides leads to accusations of treason. I just want to know what the fuck happened. 'Imran Khan Addresses Pakistani and Indian People' Summary:

&#x200B;

1. Wars are fought on miscalculations. No one thought WWI, WWII, War on Terror, Vietnam War, etc. would escalate over the years. Can India and Pakistan afford a miscalculation? 
2. Terrorism is not in the interest of Pakistan (on our own land or on others land); we are focusing on economy.
3. Pulwama was a tragedy for the Indian people.  I asked for evidence and joint investigation between Pakistan and India. We are willing to help you in anyway. You don't have the right to be judge, jury and executioner on our land.
4. You challenged our sovereignty and violated LoC. We did the same. We wanted to show that we are also capable if you want to escalate things.
5. There was some conflict in the air; Indian people lost two aircrafts. Their pilots are with us.
6. Lets talk about our issues and focus on peace, not war. Things are escalating. I hope we don't go at war. Nothing good comes out of wars.

Edit: Seeing the released video of our captured pilot is so gut wrenching. I don't know what to feel.

Edit 2: At this point, with so much of false information being released, I'm beginning to question the evidence of every news report. Confused.

Edit 3: Lost one MiG 21, Pilot MIA confirmed during conference. 

Edit 4: 1 PAK AF Jet shot down confirmed during conference

Edit 5: 2 terrorists killed, confirmed or not? It was mentioned in the conference.  I can confirm that the captured pilot in the twitter video is indeed an Indian flying pilot. He is my classmates husband Abhinandan. I have attended their wedding and i do remember him very clearly. Please don't be war. Please. [BBC is claiming that Pakistan has captured two India Jets but other news sources are claiming the opposite. ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47383634?ocid=socialflow_twitter)

The fuck is happening?

Edit 2: [Here's BBC website with live updates](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-asia-47383889)


Edit 3: From the article in Edit 2,


> Maj Gen Ghafoor also said Pakistan could have inflicted damage, ""but we don't want to go on the path of war"".


Also, Pakistan is claiming that no F-16 fighter jets was shot down and none was used in this operation  I really hope that if there is an arrest of Indian pilot, we own it. I don't want to be the country that can't respect their soldiers' martyrdom to win a propaganda war.  This will be full on propaganda from both sides now on and I won’t believe either unless I see a downed enemy aircraft, a captured/dead pilot/ a video of an aircraft being shot down. This goes for both indian and pakistani claims. I feel sad, really sad for the pilot MIA. Even in the video, he knows he can be tortured and roughed and face the fate of Sarabjeet or Kulbhushan but still he puts a brave face to say 'I can't tell you that' and adds a Sir salutation. That's just heartbreaking for me.

I really hope Imran offers to return him as a show of good faith and we can give peace a chance before this escalates. I wish FB and Twitter didn't exist. 18 years ago the situation wouldn't be this bad and I know that because 18 years ago we shot down a PAF airplane and everything was solved diplomatically. There was no stupid idiots asking for a war. I don't think this act will result in war but it sure is fueling the flames and will act as a catalyst.


Going to war is a humongous decision so we have to wait and see how all of this will play. 

But it sure looks like that Pakistan is pushing their luck. One thing is certain - there's no shortage of social media warriors on both sides. An old video of the pilot 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZitItZ8lFk Just reading this thread has been crazy, from no IAF pilots aren't allowed mustaches to ok that's one of ours Fuck all the media channels. Literally fuck them. No facts just constant warmongering, all in the name of TRP/agenda. The Pakistani military now has Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman under custody. He is a MiG 21 pilot. This is confirmed. I'm in a Liberal Pakistani group on fb and most of the people there are saying the pilot should be treated with respect and handed over quick. Just shows that not all Pakistanis are terrorists or want war.  A lot of people here seem to be of the opinion that the capture of our brave soldier(s) was Pakistan getting ""lucky"". Though that might be the case, I don't think it is. And it might be disrespectful to consider it so. 

I wrote this as a response to another comment here, and I thought I'll just share it again:

> I know people keep using the words ""lucky"" whenever the enemy does well. 

> I am an Indian. And I absolutely believe that our country is better than theirs in many fields and points of comparison. Our army is better and stronger than theirs. And our airforce is as well, of course. I am not sure of our political class -- but I would suspect, as a whole, even that is better than its Pakistani counterpart. (Unnecessary joke) perhaps one of the places where they are better than us is Coke Studio. 

> But back to the topic at hand: 

> We released no proof of the damage we did with our strike yesterday, and I am beginning to think that we didn't achieve much (other than, of course, show that we are capable and willing of cross border airforce-led skirmishes). The 300 to 600 terrorists being killed is most certainly an exaggeration. Propaganda as well. Of course, the Government didn't give that figure. But many Indians believe it. 
The Pakistanis believe we hit some trees. The truth, as it is in most cases, might rest between the claims for both sides. 

> Today, when they countered (which they said they would), they claim they intentionally hit no target but were there to show that they can. We claim that we foiled their attempts to hit their real target. (Here, I'm not too sure what to believe.)

> However, in the pursuit that followed thereafter, it looks like a well-tested and age-old Milliatry tactic was used by them -- famously used by the Mongols very often. 

> Their jets retreated. Ours went in after them (crossing the LOC again). And this time, they were ready with their defences. A trap was laid, and we fell for it. They egged us to follow them back, and in our pursuit, shot us down. 

> Of course, they knew we would be on high alert. And we would scramble our jets. 

> This doesn't feel like ""luck"". It feels calculated. 

> Undermining and underestimating them does us no good. In a way, it disrespects our own military -- our defense forces aren't fighting a mentally challenged enemy. The threat is real and capable. 

> Both are militaries aren't the best (though I know ours is stronger). But both are war hardened. Both are capable. 

> I just hope we de-escalate immediately. This war will destroy us both.  If they return the pilot in goodwill resulting in de-escalation the whole incident could be a blessing in disguise. Ok someone please STFU the media. They are creating chaos among the people. The Ind-Pak issue is just free content for them. Live Flight Tracking of aircraft PS392 entering Pakistan territory. 

Video: [https://imgur.com/a/TzOMZgG](https://imgur.com/a/TzOMZgG)

Video of the same plane earlier approaching Pakistani border north: [https://imgur.com/a/9bDVtOA](https://imgur.com/a/9bDVtOA) I think stepping one step back would be wise move here. But the question is will modi step back? He may be fearing to do so because he does not want to be labeled as coward. Let's hope he does not get flown away with rage and run behind the votes and put India into jeopardy as elections are also  coming.   I’m livid that some Indian media are more focused on criticizing Congress and calling for retaliation and NONE of them are hoping for Wing Commander Abhi to come home.  If the person captured indeed is an Indian Pilot and government is downplaying the incident, then what difference do we have between us and Pakistan? Why the fuck they didn't acknowledge earlier and released false statement that all pilots are accounted for. so where are we on the 'no moustache' and 'no names on the uniform' argument, guys? fucking peddlers of fake news ""Pakistan has stopped domestic and international flight operations from Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Sialkot and Islamabad airports.""

-- The Telegraph

https://twitter.com/ttindia/status/1100657233325477888 dude on aaj tak saying the captured pilot is actually a pakistani. imagine you're the pilot's kid. imagine someone not just refusing to acknowledge your father's existence but flat out branding him a pakistani WITHOUT proof. games people play for ratings. we don't deserve free speech.  The worst part amidst this chaos is trying to find the real source of information. I don't even know where to go and which website, news officials to trust.  Can our media for once act like a fucking responsible grownup? 

&#x200B;

Teach/Preach why wars are bad. Doesn't matter which nation wins, its the citizens that are on the losing side. Not to forget the economic shocks the wars give. Sends us back by another 15-20 years. 

&#x200B;

And God forbid if either of us uses Nukes, god! Most people really dont know how bad Nukes are. The ones on twitter act like they should be the ones calling the shots. 

&#x200B;

Also, will media preaching help? It might calm the public which in turn will reduce the pressure on the government.  Can anyone tell me how reliable the info from flightradar24 is? In the last 30mins, I saw 2 Indian military planes take off, one fly along the Pakistani border and the other fly directly towards the border. I deadass watched the second plane’s flight entry change to an international flight with no callsign, then both planes disappeared off the radar. Used the replay feature on the website to confirm.

Paranoid/10.

Edit: According to another redditor Planes were Indian Air Force, second plane changed to a Ukrainian 747 before both disappeared.

Not saying they were shot down, just they aren’t appearing on the map anymore.

I’ll verify in a bit.

Edit2: Planes were IAF Antonov An-32RE from Adampur and Ilyushin Il-76MD from unknown location. Upon further review, the second plane disappears from radar while an international flight with no callsign seems to be flying in a parallel flight plan in close proximity. The *new* second plane icon continues on course for a while until the icon flys around erratically all over map and disappears, so it’s hard to determine if the aircraft was there to begin with. Was confusing watching it live. I saw a C17 Globemaster in there somewhere. For anyone worried about a Nuclear war-its not gonna happen.

India has a no first use policy i.e we won't launch our nukes first in an offensive against another country. Our nukes are primarily there for MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) i.e if you nuke us we will destroy you.

Meanwhile, Pakistan definitely doesn't want to get wiped off the face of the earth. The primary reason they developed nukes was so that there wouldn't be another situation like 1971, where we overpowered them in conventional war and they lost half of their country i.e they won't use nukes unless they are under risk of occupation-which I don't think India wants to do.

The only scenario I'm worried about is terrorists using nukes. Hopefully Pakistan, Isi or the army or whoever is in control is sensible enough to not hand a nuke to a terrorist organisation.  One thing is sure - Our media is SHIT! Absolute garbage I have to say, yesterday the Pakistani government and military were looking like utterly incompetent fools while India was looking organised and professional. Now the situation is totally reversed.

Multiple aircrafts crashing, not sure if its from Pakistani firing or technical problems, lack of communication from the government and no statement from the leader of our country. Meanwhile the media is doing god know what, reporting bullshit and inventing stuff out of thin air. Everything looks to be disorganized and in disarray.

This is 1/3rd the Government's fault and 2/3rds the media fault. The government should have gotten ahead of all the rumours and put rest to any speculation. They should reassure the citizens and tell them what has happened.

Meanwhile, the media needs to shut the fuck up about things that they don't know about. This is what happens when your primary concern is being nationalistic instead of being objective. Like the government never even quoted a figure saying how many terrorists were killed and the news channels in an effort to outdo other channels and be the first, starts saying a bullshit figure of 300. Even in victory they're making us look like fools.  P L E A S E    D E - E S C A L A T E!

The only people who want war are the ones who haven't experienced it first hand. One thing this has shown is that both India and Pakistan have huge issues with sensationalized media. It seems like this is a very dangerous time to be doing that. If they did capture the pilot as it appears to be, then India will have no option but to either capitulate, or to escalate. 

Can't capitulate because the public will chew Modi alive. If they escalate then we're fucked
 Tv Media still makes no fucking mention of the pilot and is celebrating downing of f-16 (still rumoured) wtf Fuck Indian media all their ""experts"". How can they be so fucking dogshit. bjp's javdekar shows clip of pakistani news channel in live press conn. ANI cuts the feed 'cause of broadcasting ethics(inciteful content). what a clusterfuck. Can't believe THIS is the government's priority now.  Watching several sources. Every media house spreading hatred without reason is doing a major disservice to our country. This is the harsh reality. I know some may not like these words. 

Even if we go to war, we don’t have to stoop to such lowly levels of hateful rhetoric. We are better than this India.  Just went to Twitter for a sec. (fuck twitter, I know) 

God damn people are riled up...  and war thirsty there Politics is war without bloodshed, while war is politics with bloodshed.

Mao Zedong Why is India using Mig21 bisons in a modern combat situation? It was designed in the late 50s. Pakistan’s F16s, which were built in the 70s are far superior to the Mig21. 

We have newer aircraft. It’s almost like India just expected Pakistan to not respond. This is unacceptable when pilot’s lives are at stake  Imran Khan calls for a peace talk and Arnab Goswami titles it as, ""Imran Khan begs to India"". Fucking cunt. This warmonger should be behind the bars. Pakistan has denied targetting any military or civilian areas.

But,

MEA just emphasised that Pakistan tried to target ""Military Installments"".

This will only get worse. All I know is that a war is going to be hell. Most of us never went through a condition of national emergency like the older generation did. I wish it stays that way.  all things said and done , maybe pakistan is aware of what danger hey have called for , maybe they are afraid.

but they are acting too  mature , their media too in spite of celebrating as our media is doing kalse , they are talking about **peace** and acting very Mature I can hear jets flying overhead. This is not over yet. I hope that the pilots will be safe.

Edit: I don't wanna give away the location but all I can say is that its a major airbase. im neither indian or pakistani but I pray for both sides today, please no war. Quick question-  
Would the IAF/GoI release proof of casualties from the Balakot strike yesterday, even if they did have it?  


Pak PM in his speech mentions that there were no casualties and hence they intended no collateral damage either. Tweets from Pak claim that we only hit trees and barren land ([https://twitter.com/AsadHashim/status/1100727906249179137](https://twitter.com/AsadHashim/status/1100727906249179137)).   


If the strike actually caused terrorist casualties, it is certain that Pak would deny having had terrorists on their soil close to a military establishment.   


But would the Indian government release any such proof if they did have it? India media bodies claiming the 300 number, have no government source.  
 Can we exchange Commander Abhinandan with studio warmongers? Every single Indian, especially the ones calling for full out war, should redirect their energy and ask why the fuck the IAF is flying Mig-21s in combat. A fucking 56 year old, soviet plane.  ""Call on both sides to show restraint. Ready to further assist in strengthening counter-terrorism potential of New Delhi and Islamabad"": Russia's statement amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan 

LIVE updates here: 

https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1100741436381659137?s=19 IAF says all pilots accounted for Imran Khan, PM of Pakistan just gave a press conference. He said: 

We told India, if you do something, we will have to retaliate. I don't have an option but to retaliate if you violate our sovereignty. No country can be ""Judge, Jury, and Executioner"". I still knew they would do something because they are about to have elections. We had to do this. We tried to do no collateral damage. We didn't do anything yesterday because no one on our side died yesterday so it would not be fair to attack without knowing the overall situation.

We must use wisdom. Wars are started with miscalculations. World war 1 was a miscalculation. World war 2 was a miscalculation. America's war on terror and Vietnam war was a miscalculation. World's history tells us not to start wars. 

I want to ask India, where do we go from here? I want to ask, the type of weapons we have, can we afford a miscalculation? If we escalate, it will be out of my control and it would be out of your control. 

I want to repeat again, we are saddened by Pulwama tragedy. If you have some method to tackle terrorism, I am ready for dialogue. I am still waiting. Nevertheless, we should use diplomacy. Taliban advising india and pak to calm the fuck down.

It has come to this dear sub-continent that was once cradle of civilizations. Chain of events

1. Pakistan Air Force fires across LoC from 3 aircrafts, from their own airspace, in a show of strength. India claims target were military installations which were missed, Pakistan claims it targeted open space (source: [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100650778451238912), [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pakistan-violates-air-space-in-poonch-rajouri-nowshera-jammu-kashmir-india-pakistan-5602659/))
2. India shoots down one PAF F-16, it goes down in PoK (source: [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100644064452472832)). **Confirmed:** PAF jet [shot down](https://twitter.com/IndianExpress/status/1100695109622845440) by MiG-21 Bison (not F-16 as initially reported).
3. India crosses LoC in retaliation, 2 IAF jets shot down. One goes down in Indian territory, one in PoK. **2 IAF pilots** captured by Pakistan (source: [Pakistan Armed Forces](https://twitter.com/OfficialDGISPR/status/1100641491679150080), [Geo News](https://twitter.com/geonews_english/status/1100665010458710016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1100665010458710016&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscroll.in%2Flatest%2F914747%2Fiaf-air-strikes-sushma-swaraj-meets-chinese-foreign-minister-raises-pulwama-attack)). **Confirmed**: *only* 1 IAF pilot in Pakistan's custody and 1 MiG-21 down. [Source](https://twitter.com/Iyervval/status/1100668725651488769), [MEA](https://twitter.com/IndianExpress/status/1100695180372406274), [DSISPR](https://twitter.com/OfficialDGISPR/status/1100739613486915584)
4. A seemingly unrelated crash of IAF Mi-17 chopper in Budgam in J&K (source: [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100647281391472645)). **Confirmed**: [unrelated](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100669321796186112).

&#x200B;

Claims and counter-claims continue. Seek information in this fog of  war.

Edit 1: corrected source links

Edit 2: Not MiG-17 but Mil Mi-17 chopper went down

Edit 3: confirmation with source added for 3 and 4

Edit 4: added more sources

Edit 5: It seems like 2 IAF pilots have been captured, confirmation awaited.

Edit 6: Confirmation from MEA spokesperson added. 1 more jet and 1 pilot from India that Pakistan has claimed to bring down has not been verified by India.

Final edit: Pakistan has only 1 IAF pilot. The second jet Pakistan claimed might as well be the Budgam chopper. Imran Khan low-key had a pretty solid statement. Time for India to clean up the PR, get the pilot back and move on. Oh man, who am I kidding if only it was that easy. Weird part of this current skirmish is that both ruling parties across the border and Pakistan Army benefits from the war personally even though it is not beneficial for citizens of either nation. After three fucking hours and after pak already reports everything they are now confirming this shit. Three hours really? Why is a wing commander flying a MiG-21? Stay safe India, my heart goes out to the loved ones of the pilots.  All of us should go to sleep and say a silent prayer that things don't escalate and things don't spiral out of control when we wake up. Hopefully, things will return to normalcy pretty soon. Godspeed guys! Good night!  Does anyone understand the purpose Modi’s silence on this matter serves?  Looks like the pilot captured is real.

how can IAF claim all pilots accounted for?
 My question is simple. We do not have terrorists camps so attack on our military is an act of aggression.

Does this mean we are one step closer to all out war?! kal se dekh rha hu news, BC kya chutiya reporting karte hai India me news wale. Kal din me times now 300 terrorist killed bata rha tha, rat tak kahi se 41 ho gye. Aaj us pilot k bare me koi kuch nahi bata rha. Why are we still using Mig21 aircrafts? Aren't they old and  notoriously unreliable. Man [this](https://imgur.com/a/Qr3s9ui) is pic of our pilot who is captured. Disheartening. How can we get him back? [removed] Imran Khan just addressed the people n is asking for immediate de-escalation. [deleted] [The captured IAF pilot gives his statement after arrest](https://youtu.be/AkuQ9uCLZIY) Pakistan retracts statement, says only one Indian pilot in custody now.

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pakistan-ceasefire-violation-live-news-updates-airstrikes-across-loc-balakot-5602780/ Not good at all. People think that for the end of the world nuclear scenario the players have to be the US and Russia or China, but just India and Pakistan would suffice. Game over if these two countries lose their shit. I hope nothing has happened by the time when I wake up again. And why the fuck these news channels are not regulated when it comes to sensitive reporting. They can at least say no official reports are there yet. 

One claiming 300+ terrorists killed,  other is comparing missiles and nukes. WTF.  I dont want to be hysterical here, but what exactly happens during war, if it breaks out? How will it affect the day to day lives of us normal people?  Looks like they got our guy for real... Here is a video of him in one of the interviews.

I hope govt of India issues some very strict protocol and guidelines to our national and local media.  [removed] https://twitter.com/manakgupta/status/1100748447211114496

""Big - India hands over dossier on #PulwamaAttack to Pak’s acting high commissioner. Diplomacy has begun #BalakotAirStrike""


 Eli5 please, everybody seems to be saying that PM has given full freedom to the armed forces to do as they see fit and all that. He said the same on the day the attack happened. In India however the President is the supreme commander of the armed forces, then how is he not the one saying this and why is there no mention of him whatsoever? Is the PM acting as his spokesperson of sorts? Even if that's the case shouldn't he at least be mentioned in a way like ""he is of the opinion such and such and we all agree with him"" Nothing but twitter hype and fake Alex Jones level news, this is a perfect example of the pernicious sinister nature of social media and fake news. i dont want to be termed as anti national but as current narrative goes it is very negative for us. Media houses running their own versions of story on both sides of countries are real problem for more hatred being spread. Truth being commander abhinandan being captured and 3 videos making rounds in social media of his capture and him sipping tea treated well. Not even one media house has shown it, they are busy thumping chest whole day about shooting down pak f16  [removed] What is going on? Can anyone post the official and verified sources from both the sides. People are reporting unverified things on twitter. This would be appreciated. How is our media reporting guys? I dont watch TV. I am asking how is Republic/Aajtak/Zee/TimesNow ? Are they still fucking biased here/something for the sake of TRP? Or are they being sensible here?

&#x200B; That's it? That's fucking it?  From MEA's press release we now know,

* IAF has only one pilot MIA. Pakistan claims it has two IAF pilots.

* PAF was targeting Indian military infrastructures in response to counter terrorism operations by IAF.

* IAF's MiG-21Bis was shot down not Su-30MKI as claimed by Pakistan.

* IAF shotdown 1 PAF aircraft in a dogfight. Why do we still have the Mig 21? Why has it not been replaced by a new fighter like the SAAB Gripen?

The IAF has been requesting the acquisition of new aircraft to replace the Mig 21 since the 2000s. I can't believe it still hasn't been followed through on.

Failure of both the previous and the current government.  To add on to my last comment, there were lots of people claiming India is becoming too autocratic with the suppression of media but if the media is so fucking stupid and unreliable, what the fuck do you expect?

If it's so easy to disprove you then it will be very easy to suppress you as well.  So apparently the Pakistani F16s entered Indian territory and lured IAF fighters including the MIG 21 that crashed into disputed territory where they were shot down.

If we can prove that they did indeed violate our airspace it would be good.  If anything is true, the sensationalist media is not helping anyone. 

Stay safe, hope everything stabilizes soon [deleted] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gives-pakistan-dossier-on-jem-role-in-pulwama-terror-attack/articleshow/68188163.cms And Jaitley goes on record saying ""If USA can kill Osama, why cant we""

&#x200B;

What a joke of a minister! When I thought something sensible will come up from our ministers, these guys just go lower!

&#x200B;

Instead of de-escalating this, these guys are escalating it further. Can we have someone sensible come out and talk to calm some tits?

EDIT-  [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/us-navy-seals-osama-bin-laden-anything-possible-today-arun-jaitley-iaf-airstrike-1466187-2019-02-27) What bothers me the most is, Indian Govt's refusal to share evidence of IAF's attack on Balakot and letting Indian media speculate. Indian Govt could have shared before and after satellite images of the bombed area or flight paths taken by Mirages. 

While Pakistan Govt and PAF retaliated for bombing terrorist camps, and in process captured multiple images and short clips of captured IAF Wing Commander and shared it to the Pakistani media minutes after the incident took place. 

Now, India has been cornered. Captured commander will be paraded and India will be forced to deescalate. yea, republic tv still in denial.  'lies, bunch of lies' they say, totally unironically Abhinandan is the real hero here. 

 > Turkey will stand with Pakistan against India aggression. 

You seriously can't be taking sides at this moment.  JeM's mission is accomplished... No one recognizes this [deleted] I have massive respect for our armed forces, but zero respect for some of the media houses, and specifically Arnab Goswami. He is fanning the fires of unnecessary hatred among people with his style of debating.  Pakistani govt has announced It will release the captured pilot tomorrow. Pakistan spreading old photos  

https://twitter.com/PressTV/status/1100648989567918081

Amazing. Official verified media peddling pictures of an IAF Hawk crash in Odisha from 2018. Morons.

There's many lost, but tell me who has won  
The trench is dug within our hearts  
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart For one thing we can confirm that the government didn't expect this shit to happen.

They are rushing to meet etc.

As opposed to already expecting some sort of escalation. Hmm. @ImranKhanPTI will be addressing the nation shortly - Pak PM House

This announcement follows an emergency session of the National Command Authority, the highest security body in Pakistan — the guys who determine if and when to go nuclear.

BREAKING: Confirmed. Pakistan has in its captivity Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, a MiG-21 Bison pilot. Statement from the Indian government shortly. #JustIn | Ministry of External Affairs to brief media at 3:15 pm. ""Pak targetted military installations."" the spokesperson said.  

So...what now?  I might be asking a stupid question, but what harm is there in admitting that Pakistan has custody of our pilot?

(If the claims by Pakistan are true) Indian Pilot in Pakistan is safe and being treated decently: https://twitter.com/salmanmasood/status/1100736311797927937?s=19 Rumors are being spread, polarizing memes are being shared on every platform like crazy. People in this case really need to understand not to believe anything that is said at it's face value.
See news reports from both the countries once to understand how toxic it really is.
 Silver lining of these tragic events: we now know which news stations to avoid like the plague. I suggest a sub section of live updates . It's really confusing to see a list of the same article with a different title. Something like "" Indian aircraft downed by Pakistani forces (date)"" and then underneath that the relevant articles This whole situation throws light on just how disorganized, irresponsible and jingoist Indian news media is. Why the fuck are you bringing in retired old farts who have barely have any first hand knowledge of what is going on right now?

How hard is it to just wait until there are official confirmations from the spokespersons of the armed forces? NDTV seems to gotten their shit together today, not seeing any of the wild claim on social media being reported there.   Pak is winning the PR war that's for sure. https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/pakistan-india-strikes-back-attack-today-iaf-paf-loc-pok-jaitley-indian-air-force-air-strikes-us-osama-bin-laden/373514

> If Navy SEALs can do it, why can’t we: Jaitley lauds IAF air strikes referring to US killing bin Laden in Pak

I hate fuckers like these, giving statement from a public office, in times like this MOST MEDIA CHANNELS DOUBLING DOWN ON THE WAR SENTIMENT.

WE are fucked. Fuck  Kind request to Government of India please issue immediate action over Indian media for playing with the emotions of the less educated people of India and not presenting facts. I hope everyone is listening to Imran Khan's address and understands war will be suicide for both countries.  It seems like Pakistan army is treating Wing Commander Abhinandan with dignity that they would expect had they been captured. Gives hope that he will be reunited with his family some time soon...

- Quint live thread

Which has mostly official sources and statements. So it might have less frequent updates.

Shiv Aroor is pro-India commentator and host.  Whether he reports Indian sources or Pakistani sources he is marking them unconfirmed or confirmed based on official statements and evidence. He is also calling out fake news being spread. 

He seems to be quite reliable. 

- NatSecJeff - https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff


NatSecJeff. He has clear pro-Pakistani bias. But he is retweeting and reporting news from both Indian and Pakistani sources. 

 Confirmed 1 Pilot MIA

Acknowledged by Ind Gov that he is in Pakistan's custody. [removed] After all of this shit is dealt with, a bill should be brought forward to restrict news channels from profiting from all of their coverage of crises like this. The levels that the media has stooped to for views and clicks has caused everybody to act like hypertensive buffoons. Now everybody is embarrassed and unsettled because they're being dealt the same shit by Pakistanis on social media that they themselves were spewing just 24 hour earlier.

1) How genuine do you think is the Pak PM's plea for talks with India?

2) What would it realistically take for us to agree to resume some form of dialogue with Pakistan?

3) Is there any likelihood at all of a re-establishment of diplomatic relations to at least pre 26/11 levels? Where is the RakshaMantri? My folks just shared photos of a Modi alt account tweeting something about Geneva convention on Whatsapp and I do not know how to deal with this anymore. 

&#x200B;

'Tis not a good day.  I haven't checked Twitter all day, but I'm sure Pakistani Arnab Zaid Hamid is living his wet dream today.  This is bad for democracy. 

With all the media attention focused toward the borders, a lot of what's happening within the country are gonna go unchecked. 

Who are creating these memes, photoshopped gory images and videos? IT cells? I'm not from either country, would just like to respectfully say that I feel a lot of fake and hysterical news floating around, nothing major likely to happen and no one stupid enough to use nukes.

Media loves to hype these things, last year when US attacked Syria they made it sound like the Russians were getting ready to engage US airforce and navy (Russians not that stupid), nothing happened.

Nothing will happen here. Hello to all the people who are going to scroll past this bs AGAIN just for fun I feel shame for being part of community where older generations still thinks 120 mill population (including my dad) can wipe out 20 mil population in 5 hours. I don’t see a little hesitation in their voice while saying wipe out 20 mil people. They seems more dangerous than people started WWII. Younger generation (my brother)  believe war is like playing Call of Duty of theirs PS4’s. Thanks to the brainwashing politicians and their propaganda media. 
 Fucking news channels comparing missiles and firepower. Disgusting. So I think. Here is how it really went. Pakistan aircrafts entered India airspace early morning> they tried to do the same manoeuvre like the IAF yesterday> IAF air craft were already there and spotted them> PAF began to flee/go back> IAF somehow decided to 'pursue' them> PAF took advantage of that to outmaneuvere the IAF planes and bring two of them down> PAF captures the pilot> Profit

Somewhere between this moments, IAF might have managed to bring an F16 down. But that's speculation at best. [wtf is this shit :(](https://twitter.com/za_chaudhry/status/1100705256130924546?s=21)

Edit 1: [Pic 1: Him being in PA custody.](https://i.imgur.com/Btltn7F.jpg)

[Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/U92OUGX.jpg) Man the BJP press conference was a shit show of the highest order!  Fucking hell the Indian side is handling the information disbursement very, very poorly. And OTOH Pakistan is doing it well. Our media is so shit. NDTV seems to have collected themselves and aren't letting war mongering ex-servicement bursting nerves speak for too long. Other channels are just wholeheartedly going for it, letting people say any and everything on their channels. Why can't they stop with their cringy animations and hyperbole. Imran khan's press conference aimed at the idea of avoiding war and cooperation. Meanwhile indian media will probably highlight how imran khan has said that pakistan can decimate india.  Lol zee news just said Pakistani airforce us facing an issue of shortage of fuel and a meeting has been called. The media literally takes the entire country as a laughing stock.  One thing is for sure after this, Indian media is a joke not only here but globally as well. They run their own narrative omitting lot of facts. Always keep your eyes and ears open, they didnt even addres abhinandan issue saying all pilots were safe. Twitter folks had more info than them ? impossible, they are just denying it. No questions taken as well.  Truth is the first casualty of war. It's a bit retarded though that India still uses MiG-21s for air defense/attack. OMFG fuck Zee news to hell.  I feel like the media are also the terrorists here. Meanwhile:

Spread. I'm in Jodhpur, tensions are rising here no kidding. Jets flying over all day (Jodhpur is India's largest Airbase and is close to Pakistan border.) Just so everyone knows: We are not going to war. Seriously. There's no way something like this would be allowed to happen, two nuclear armed countries that have already fought 4 wars. MAD, refers to mutually assured destruction, which is a given in any military conflict involving nuclear weapons. People on both sides realize that even if a conventional war is fought, the country losing might just decide to take the other out, which would mean the other country would respond and tl;Dr everyone dies™. If this escalates further, the United States, Russia, China or UNSC might have to intervene, and make both sides back down. This is a truly f'ed up situation, and we all need to calm down now. Whether we like it or not, in the 21st Century, we can only resolve this through diplomacy.  It didn't even take them half a day to put an board outside my railway station applauding Modi for the bombing and this happens today. This feels like a Curb your enthusiasm meme. But damn this is a serious situation and besides NDTV seems like every fucking news station has lost its mind. It's so obvious they are trying to capitalize on the patriotism just for trps and it's frustrating to watch. It's almost hate speech, inciting people. TOI is showing idiocy at highest level revealing abhinandan's father's name and place of living.

This says that Pak shot down 2 Aircrafts and captured 1 Indian pilot How can there be so much confusion around something so certain. We don't even have any info on what's happening at ground zero. There is no official statement which clarifies things or provides proof. News channels are shouting from yesterday with their so called official sources. On the other hand we have no idea how many of our soldiers are injured/dead because of their stupidity. How do you come up with such a big scale response to eliminate camps within days of such an incursion at pulwana. Was their good planning to back it up or was it just to save face which later became dick measuring contest between both countries top officials. I don't know what to believe. Wtf is happening?? Are we at war? https://mobile.twitter.com/asmashirazi/status/1100667866033147907


YO WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS??? SOMEBODY PLEASE SAY THIS IS FAKE. PLEASE!  No official government statement is biggest issue at the moment. Anyone knows about the second pilot? Is he okay? So apparently they airports that were shut down will start civilian flights again. Hopefully things will de-escalate after the 3:15PM press conference [deleted] LoL so basically Pakistan is right and they dont know what to say? So they put this brief out without admitting anything but admitting at the same time? what the actual fuck? No questions :@ Raveesh Kumar, MEA: One Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by Indian Air Force. In this engagement we have lost one MiG 21. Pilot is lost in action. Pakistan claims he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts

https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1100695138819547136 Holy shit what a shit show. So we shot down one of their planes and they deny it. We have one pilot missing in action while they claim they have 2 in their custody.   so, if the pakistani pilot lost his life to abhinandan's mig, will he be tried in pakistan's court now? or is he a PoW? but no war was declared?

edit : no war Wait they said Pak targeted military installation inside our airspace! This seems way too real. Twitter is a weird medium. The trending topic is praising Pakistan and its air force, yet their stock market which would affect the common person more has tanked today.  Now that it's clear that they have one of our pilots what news of the second one? What a shitshow. Our leaders need to stand up and deescalate the situation. Some diplomacy is required. Abhinandan's being interviewed. He says he is being looked after well. Hope there's no coercion.

Pakistan has claimed there are 2 pilots. Any information on the 2nd?  Why is India still deploying these Mig 21 flying coffins vs F16? It makes no sense, we have Mig-29 etc. Maybe we should have waited for those S400s...

Pakistan has rejected the dossier we gave to them for JeM. What the hell did you expect ? And the sorry bit is, people from my own state who should have had the wisdom after serving in the civil services end up saying that Imran Khan should get a Nobel peace prize.....what the hell ?  Do you guys still not understand how Pakistan operates ? 

Bots / trolls / people blaming the system / bhakts / liberals / Pakistani / Indian sloganeering will not be tolerated. I shall personally report them if that is the case.

Please note that this is not an accusatory question, rather a solemn one. I am an apolitical person who cares about this nation's interest like any other Indian. After I accidentally ""doxxed"" myself here, I got several negative messages from both ""bhakts"" and ""liberals"" alike. I was labeled many names because I am a Kashmiri, but I do not care about it. What I care about is the nation, which presses me to ask this question today. Even in a time of near-war, we succumbed to trolls, memes, fake news, disinformation, misinformation, you name it, instead of relying on official sources from our government. A section of our media still lauded Imran Khan for the so-called ""peace gesture"" of releasing the pilot, even though it is in accordance with the Geneva convention. Even the commando brigade of journalists in the country thought that Pak has buckled. These jokers just made war a joke. A Kashmiri politican says that ""Imran Khan has acted like a statesman"". Are you serious ?!?

Then there is a politician who says the strikes will give him and his party 22 votes in a state. There is political bickering over the fact that a PM did not call an all-party meet and instead was tending to the matter at hand. Did George W. Bush call an all party meet right after 9/11 ? Even he took 4 days before a joint session of Congress was called. But, there is political bickering over it.

In the war for truth over social media, many forgot that :

* India's strike was not targeting military / civilian installations, only terrorist camps.
* Pakistan crossed Indian airspace in retaliation to ensure the country does not implode due to Jihadi backlash and to save face, with a clear intent to target Indian Army installations ; thus, the escalation was from the Pakistani side.
* The control of the escalation ladder despite the capture of our pilot stood with India - India decided not to escalate and instead pursued strong diplomatic ties to ensure that the airman is returned unconditionally.
* Pakistan executes a terrorist attack before our elections, claims they were Kashmiris, says it has no terrorists attacking India on it's soil, asks for evidence, hoping for a status quo in relationships later on until it can repeat cowardly acts like this.
* All the while, Pakistan follows a good disinformation campaign of lies and denials until the truth finally comes out.
* When the Wg Cmd from the Pakistan's side passed away as a result of his injuries after the dogfight, Pakistan did not even acknowledge his passing - this is the same country which denied there were army regulars in Kargil. It likes to live in a world of its own lies, deceit and conceit, and there are Punjab politicians who want to talk to them.

Then there is yesterday's press conference where the top brass was clearly embarrassed at hearing questions from 3rd grade journalists like ""aapka pilot aa raha hai, aapko kaisa lag raha hai, Imran Khan ne shaanti ka prastaav rakha hai""....

Are we really Indians worth fighting for ? If not, I request Redditors to spread the word of serving the nation in whatever capacity first. Thank you. Indians who are truly not awakened, please realise that each of us play a very crucial role of keeping the morale of the armed forces up, irrespective of caste, creed, political leaning, religion, state etc. Please do not fall into the trap of fake news and Pakistan's deception tactics in every sphere they operate in, whether PR, military, diplomatic, or journalistic.

Jaish E Mohammed: We ANNHILATED 40 Indian Paratroopers thru a suicide bomber, all while sitting in the comfort of our homes in Pak YEAAAA!!  Is the video of Wing Commander Abhinandan being questioned legit? It's being circulated everywhere like crazy. Saw the brave IAF’s wing commander’s video when he was captured by Pak on twitter. He was beaten before their army arrested him.
Seeing the recent development, it seems Pak had  planned this in such a way to lure in Indian aircrafts then shoot them down. They knew we were on high alert and would launch our jets within minutes.
Still I don’t understand why didn’t a complete squadron was used to retaliate.

My hunch is these psyops will continue for next few days, till their army is able to clean the Balakot site. 

Also please beware, many old images of Indian planes shot down is circulating in the Pak media and social media. FAKE NEWS: Pakistani Twitter handle with 500k+ followers peddles video of Feb 19 Surya Kiran crash survivor Vijay Shelke in Bangalore, saying it is captured IAF pilot.

https://twitter.com/ShivAroor/status/1100660234090151937 Does the prime minister not have 5 minutes for an official statement during a crisis?  May the people of both countries have a safe night and wake up to some sense of sanity.  The next 12-24 hours are critical.   Lets send Arnab Goswami and Zahid Hamid on the border with AK-47.  Let them decide who wins it. After all those two want it more than anyone

Let the soliders stay at home Am I alone in thinking that Modi's foolhardiness has boxed us into a corner? Idiot can't deescalate now coz he will lose the fanatic base that pushed for this in the first place and I shudder to think what escalation will lead to. I don't see us coming out of this looking good... :( Abhinandan is fast emerging as a hero in my eyes. After taking a beating from the locals he stands up tall with his hands behind his back and says ""I'm sorry sir, that's all I'm allowed to tell you."" and even goes on to ask for information and asks his captors who they are. He flummoxed his captors with his reliance on procedure. He had to do it twice when they didn't heed his first refusal. I spent the day reading on Reddit and watching news where all I got to know was that Indian media were stuffing their own opinions and ignoring actual news. Spreading hate against Pakistan and making this matter deviate from the actual point. 

We were to fight the terrorists right? Then why all I see is people celebrating and belittling the opposite countries and making people more agitated, turning this into another Indo Pak feud which was originally an attack towards terrorism. 

I don't know if many young Indians know the adversities and traumatic impact war has on people and society. I know people posting online and saying agitative things filled with hatred and pointless accusations which just make things more complex and promote more hate.

If you watch news just check the news well and get your facts right. There's no way Indian media is showing the entire truth. Don't go out saying hateful stuff after watching NDTV.

Please report anyone who's promoting war or hateful comments that might agitate someone. 

**The youth needs to understand that it's not India VS Pakistan, it's India Vs terrorism and supporting a nuclear war with Pakistan will just bring ruin to the country and if you don't know how actual war looks like please search it online and enlighten yourself**

God I'm praying for no war. Don't let any human die because of this. 


 Pakistanis on Twitter using old crashes of MIG-27 and Hawk 132 to say they have shot down IAF jets.

Pathetic. Guys, any confirmation regarding the surgical strike IAF took on, where they're claiming that over 300 terrorists were killed? It worrying how much propaganda we hear and not a lot of real news in our mainstream media.  I had  recently commented on someone accusing the Pakistani army of ill-treating their prisoner of war. 

Another video has surfaced which points to the contrary:

I'll just copy paste my older comment here as well:

> It (his leaked video) gave me goosebumps. But he stood tall, attentive. Answered with dignity. You could see there was fear and terror, yet he maintained courage. What a brave soldier! 

> A small opposing perspective to what you said, though. Forgive me if this is the wrong time. 

> I think, based on what we've seen till now, he has been treated better than I would have ever expected. 

> The locals wanted to bash his head in with rocks and boulders. And the Pakistani army didn't let that happen (fired warning shots).

> He was hurt and hit, but as far as we can tell, not tortured. 

> By the looks of it, they are treating him with dignity as well -- as most prisoners of war should be treated. 

> Of course, he was bleeding. And he could have been treated better. But the cynic in me expected way worse. 

> Seeing him and how he is treated by the opposing army gives me more hope than pessimism.  (edit: maybe, if the situations were reversed, I fear more mistakes could have been made from our side. I would still like to optimistically believe we would do the right thing -- just as Pakistan is doing now.)

> And I don't want to use this word, but I will -- he is now a ""tool"" in the diplomatic de-escalation process. 

> I hope he (and if there are others) return home soon. 

> This nightmare has got to end.

The way he is being treated (for whatever cynical reasons our minds can conjure), it gives me hope for a slightly less bleak future.

> ""The tea is fantastic."" This whole situation with the media, government, terrorists and Pakistan is making me very angry, and I hate myself for that because this is exactly what all of them want.

The terrorists, Government and media all want you to be afraid and angry because it benefits them. This is what they want.  Any news from PM yet? Republic is reporting that he gave a free hand to the army to respond any way they see fit. This means war right? I'm scared right now wtf?

So confusing  Imran Khan claims two Indian jets were shot down. That means there could be another pilot.

What's the situation on this?
 this is all really so confusing. Is there any neutral news source for all this info that we can actually trust ? Good day to learn about [our borders](http://www.indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Kashmir-Map.jpg) Now what, we wait? I'm still a bit unclear on the sequence of events. Did the 2 jets of ours that got shot down, were they in Indian territory or Pakistani territory or Disputed Territory when they got hit?

And when did the PAF F16 get shot? Before or after and where?

 When the rivals allow each other to reassure their domestic audiences, the chances of conflict go down. Now, facts have intruded.

Hope it blows over and you'll all be alright  Pakistan has confirmed that only one pilot is in their custody. 

Can someone tell me who was in the video that was circulating on Twitter showing his charred remains? Was that an indian pilot?  Neither Pakistan or India have said anything about another pilot's death.  I know I’m on the India sub, but where do you guys/gals suggest I should do my research to catch up on the history between India and Pakistan in an unbiased way?

I admittedly know far less about the conflicts that have occurred than I should and feel like I really need to catch up. 

Feel dumb not being up to date on a major world conflict, one that results in casualties.  [deleted] https://youtu.be/xcfUOLYX5pU

Unidentified jets with no destination. I've seen two fly out of Lahore over the past few hours and I think they disappear after a bit. PAF ops? Just some things to keep in mind about these two countries:
The majority of Kashmiris want independence, however both India and Pakistan won't allow it. India needs full control of Kashmir to gain access into central Asia, a border with Afghanistan, and to diminish Chinese-Pakistan relations. Pakistan needs control of Kashmir to deny India those options and to strengthen their foreign policy options. Part of China's OBOR initiative is to gain access to Pakistan's Gwadar port because it will allow China to bypass the Strait of Malacca. Also, keep in mind that both Pakistan and India have increasing populations. The Himalayan Tibet is pretty much both Pakistan's and India's water tower. Control over that water supply is essential.
 BJP Facebook troll farms already on full damage control...

None mentions the pilot. But apparently MIA means he may be have been killed,captured,deserted .Instead they could once in a while accept that is captured by them and assured us that measures will be taken accordingly for his release immediately.Now i feel sad for our pilot being held there for how long. Imran khan press conference :
 He said that wars always have disastrous effects and he is still ready to cooperate with india to bring down terrorist groups and says he doesn't want the land of Pakistan to be used for terrorism's purpose.  Any defence experts here? There are a lot of opinions floating around in this forum and it's leading to nowhere. Most of the comments are from guys like me, who get our dose of information from news channels/ twitter. We probably have no idea about how these things escalate, and what happens if it does. 

Is there anyone out there who is qualified enough to comment and can give an unbiased account of the real possibilities and what happens then? And what should be the course of actions for both nations? [deleted] A dossier was handed over to Pakistan side with specific details of JeM complicity in Pulwama terror attack and the presence of JeM terror camps and its leadership in Pakistan.It was conveyed that India expects Pakistan to take immediate and verifiable action against terrorism emanating from territories under its control: MEA

SOURCE : https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1100749246993711105 Make no mistake, if this escalates it’s going to be because of fake news. Not in the conservative nonsense buzzword, but in the actual sense of the phrase. Is it true that things are setting down guys? I see lesser updates in the thread. My parents where flying from Thailand when this all happened. Here is an image of their flight route. https://i.imgur.com/SrtxMOM.jpg So basically, we are back at square one. Until the next terrorist attack I guess... Pakistan claims to shoot down a jet and arrest the pilot and India claims to shoot down a jet and the pilot escaped. And 2 jets crashed in Kashmir. Who to trust? Hmmmm Is anyone here willing to accept that yesterday's strike were a blunder by modi government? IndiaTV still with the Pakistan blaming only, no mention of the pilot yet. 10/10 journalism  Non-Indian here.

Why is nobody talking about the fact that the Islamic terrorist group (Jaish-e-Mohammad) that started this whole mess and led to 40 deaths on Indian soil is funded and protected by Pakistan?

It doesn’t make any sense ... how can Pakistan honestly say they are against terrorism and then shoot down two Indian fighter jets that are going after terrorists. They should be helping the Indian military target and destroy these groups ...

Somebody needs to catch Pakistan on this bullshit. Pakistani here. Let me tell you, we dont want a war. Many inncocents will die. And those who are om twitter saying lets start war are you guys ok? Seriosly, its not a small issue. Not everything is a movie.

""We are ready to sacrifice"" really? Sacrifice what? Nothing will remain in the end. both have atomic bombs etc and you we share borders! Just think about that one child who is struggling hard to get grades. Imagine him being blown up or the one who is playing or just came into the world. Seriously, what is wrong with you? The one who is not even born. 

As for respected AbhiAnand, I hope the pakistani Govt returns him, he has a family and is treated with kindness the way our religion teaches us. The other pilot is in the hospital for treatement as per news Here's how the timeline looks from an Indian perspective

* Pakistan backed JeM kill 44 CRPF soldiders.
* We retaliate with air strikes (a week later), and claim to have bombed a JeM facility resulting in significant casualties for JeM. 
* Within 24 hours, Pakistan retaliates. They target military installations (according to us), and have now even captured one IAF pilot. The video of him being attacked by Pakistani civilians is both sad and humiliating. 

At this stage, they hold all the cards. They can release the pilot as a gesture of goodwill. We will have no option but to accept if we don't want to go to war. And a war will be disastrous, so I hope that we are really not considering it as an option. 

The current Indian government has completely mishandled the situation and it seems we seriously underestimated Pakistan's capability to strike back. Now we've ended up giving Pakistan (and Imran Khan) an excellent opportunity to broker peace and garner major international claim. We didn't achieve anything and we've ended up with our egg on our faces. Fake wars manufacturing fake consent. Always remember the events that brought this about. Pakistan receiving 21 billion dollars and a corrupt army trying to justify their existence. So the bombing happens right on time. Modi trying to justify his failures and reelections so following attacks happens. No side is innocent and both sides win. The only side that loses are the people of both nations. See increased state control on speech to defend the ""integrity"" of the motherland from both sides happen now. 

&#x200B;

This isn't a war of nations against each other. This is a war of corrupt money and blood sucking bureaucracy on it's own people. Question is will both of our nations see or will we follow that state preached propaganda. [removed] [Breaking](https://twitter.com/ReutersIndia/status/1100653478479835136?s=19): Taliban says India, Pakistan clashes will affect Afghan peace process.

We really have come down to this.  War mongerers WhatsApp groups are silent. Once it deescalates they will again start sending shit forwards.  I'm in Mumbai, on fucking Marine Drive, eating bhelpuri and commenting on the India v Pak situation. 

FML.  Meanwhile, Narendra ji is scheduled to address more than a crore BJP karyakartas (as claimed) tomorrow via one of the biggest video conference till date. ""[I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to tell you this.](https://twitter.com/MalihaMansoori/status/1100732036174688256)""

The balls on this guy. After all their official claims and fake images, their credibility comes down to producing that 1 IAF pilot they claim to have arrested.

I'm pretty sure that was just another bluff. So, even the word of the Official Pakistani Army rep cannot be trusted, mind you. If the video of the captured pilot is true then why the hell did we go back there? Was there a dogfight and we had to defend? I'd be pissed at the airforce and PM if we tried our luck again after yesterday."

## Tl;dr

On 22 January 2020, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw of the Delhi High Court heard arguments by the Indian Journalists Union (IJU) and the Culture Workers Support Trust regarding their impleadment in the defamation suit filed by influential artist, Subodh Gupta seeking removal of Instagram posts and news reports containing anonymous allegations of sexual harassment against him. Read more about the case [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-directs-subodh-gupta-to-respond-to-impleadment-application-filed-by-indian-journalists-union-and-allows-scene-and-herd-to-contest-anonymously-for-now/). Senior Advocate, Ritin Rai and Advocate, Shreya Munoth appearing for IJU emphasized that news reports cannot be de-indexed without providing journalists an opportunity to defend their reportage.  They further submitted there was a distinction between merely republishing defamatory allegations and reporting on them. They also highlighted the harm caused by de-indexing of news reports from Google search engine results by comparing it to removal of a book from the shelves of booksellers.

## Private lawsuits also affect press freedom

At the beginning of the hearing, Endlaw J. noted that this was not a Public Interest Litigation and asked the counsels for IJU why they should be impleaded in a private defamation suit. In response, the counsels explained that private defamation suits can also violate the media's freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and journalists’ right to carry on their profession under Article 19(1)(g). In support of this proposition, the counsels cited a recent decision of the German Constitutional Court where it was held that prior to directing de-indexing of any online content from search engine results, courts must consider the impact of such de-indexing on the freedom of speech and expression of the publisher even in disputes under private law.

## Is being de-indexed from Google really that big a deal?

During the previous hearing, the Court had passed an interim injunction and directed Google to de-index URLs hosting defamatory content against the plaintiff from their search engine results. Since this was the scope of the interim relief granted, Endlaw J. asked the counsels whether de-indexing from Google search engine results is a problem if the articles are still available on the website of the news publication. In response to this, the counsels explained that Google was the most commonly used search engine and removal from its search results would make it very difficult for individuals to access the news reports. To highlight the importance of search engines, the counsels compared removing a news article from Google search results to removing a book from the shelves of booksellers.  

## Reportage =/= republication

A large part of the hearing was devoted to discussing whether the press can have a better right than the person running the HerdandScene Instagram account to publish allegations against the plaintiff. Endlaw J. quizzed the counsels on whether republication of allegations which have been found to be prima facie defamatory by journalists is permissible. The counsels appearing for IJU clarified that there was a distinction between merely republishing allegations and reporting on them. They submitted that journalists have qualified privilege to report on the existence of allegations even if the allegation itself is unverified.

## Of “errors” and their inevitability

The counsels for IJU drew the Court’s attention to various news articles whose removal has been sought by Subodh Gupta that either don’t refer to him at all or only reference his case briefly while making a broader point. To illustrate the problem, Mr. Rai cited [**this article**](https://www.firstpost.com/living/metoo-india-kochi-biennale-foundation-drops-inquiry-into-sexual-misconduct-allegations-against-riyas-komu-6348811.html) by FirstPost about the Kochi Biennale dropping its inquiry into sexual harassment charges agains another artist, Riyaz Komu which was included in the list of defamatory articles submitted by Subodh Gupta. However, a bare perusal of the article reveals that the article doesn’t refer to Subodh Gupta at all. Subodh Gupta’s lawyers argued that this was an error but such overbroad and unnecessary censorship is inevitable because Subodh Gupta has not impleaded any of the media houses or journalists who could have defended the news reports and provided a counter viewpoint to the Court.

## Need for anonymity in the art industry

Senior Advocate, Jayna Kothari appeared on behalf of the Culture Workers Support Trust and argued in favour of the Trust’s impleadment since the defamation suit raised important questions of law about non-availability of formal greivance redressal mechanisms within the art world and the need to preserve anonymity in cases of sexual harassment where there is possibility of retaliation.  

## The plaintiff’s stance

Senior Advocate, Sandeep Sethi appearing for Subodh Gupta stated that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013  imposes bar on media reporting and argued that if journalists are not allowed to write about sexual harassment allegations even when a formal complaint is made, how can journalists be allowed to write about anonymous allegations made on social media? He insisted that his client’s right to due process, privacy and reputation had been seriously prejudiced by anonymous defamatory allegations. He stated that the content of the news reports was defamatory on the face of it, and even the journalists who had written these articles could not oppose their de-indexing because they had not complied with norms laid down by the Press Council of India.

The next date of hearing in the case is 4 February 2020 and the counsels for IJU and Culture Workers Support Trust will make their rejoinder arguments then.

Unverified,Spread of videos of police Brutality against muslims in UP is kind of alarming,42,eh6d5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eh6d5h/spread_of_videos_of_police_brutality_against/,5,1577657787.0,"There is a widespread fear among the entire muslim community in India. The police brutality videos are fueling this fear. 

I am really concerned about this because I was talking to my dad yesterday and he referred to some videos he saw. (Just for context, he is from South and mostly watches local news, so he was not getting much information about these issues in news.) But despite the distance and disconnect from issues, he received tens of videos of violence against muslims over last two weeks. 

Honestly, I am really afraid of how polarizing affect these videos would have on the community as a whole. Here are reasons for my concern :

1. Though police is at fault, this spread of videos (real or fake) creates a biased view of system and skews their belief system, hence making the entire community irrational.
2. Islam is already on a slippery slope and a single bad move by one guy can cause terrible damage to already battered community. 

Sometimes I feel, internet stoppage is not that bad under such circumstances but even then how long can we stop it?(not saying stopping internet is right but just making a point in favor of it)

I wonder what could be done to get people out of this frenzy of viral violent videos against the community? Honestly, all these problems would not have raised, had the media been unbiased. They are seriously doing extreme damage by forcing people to rely on these unverified sources.",strngerstruggle," >I wonder what could be done to get people out of this frenzy of viral violent videos against the community?

They are innocent victims and so their stories must be told, spread and archived for future generations of all religions all around the world to learn. I don't support internet shutdowns or clamping on such videos. That is effectively siding with their oppressors, and may actually further harm these victims in the justice system.

&#x200B;

But one thing that can be done is to create the infrastructure - a network of lawyers, doctors, accurate reporting of personal stories, crowd funding, donations, evidence archiving - to help these victims against the bullying of the authorities. When people don't know such help is available and when information about victims is lacking, scared minds will imagine the worst.

For example, that old poor muslim bystander who was forced into a jeep by Delhi police - what happened to him? where is he now and in what condition? Without this information, many will imagine he's either dead, tortured or incarcerated for a long time without any help. That kind of fear and helplessness breeds extreme anger.

But seeing that these victims are cared for and receiving help by volunteers from general society will douse some of that anger. It helps people realize society is not as heartless as they had feared and that they are not alone. This is true not just for muslim victims but all victims of state atrocities.

The rightwing anyway looks at all muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathizers. There will also inevitably be some  violent muslims. Both those extremist groups are lost causes any way.

It's the moderates and fence sitters on both sides who should be brought together in concrete ways through personal stories and personal connections. These surprise protests themselves have achieved this to a greater extent than anybody imagined just a month ago. Now some more effort should be put into building stronger connections between victims of state atrocities, moderates and fence sitters. The information is too diffuse right now - some are in tweets which many people don't have access to, some are in people's minds which other people don't have access to. It has to be run and coordinated like a medical or SOS helpline. That Kerala flood rescue effort is a good model for this I think. This too is a widespread disaster with many innocent victims, just that it's perpetrated by the government instead of nature. Not really sure what is your point here? Not share the police brutality videos? I get your concern, but the alternative is to not know about these atrocities at all, until it reaches ones doorstep. I feel these videos are eye opening. Most hindus may not like Muslims, but i doubt their conscience agrees with this cruelty. The environment is now being set. All it takes is just one muslim among the 200 crores of them to turn psycho and completely destroy the image of the entire community and in turn, destroy the country. 

Considering the odds, i am not optimistic. This is infact what the party might be trying to fish by being brutal against the muslims in UP. Another “godhra train burning” to create another “2002 riots”, but at a wider scale.

The current government is infact a pro-terrorist party."
Unverified,"SP of Dimapur, Nagaland confirms that the girl blackmailed the boy for Rs 2 lakh. He didn't pay and rape case was filed. No rape [Unverified]",94,2y5t3g,http://i.imgur.com/vusNYxd.png,26,1425696133.0,,killm," Aur bolo, ""Rapists must be killed in public, lol"". Fucking armchair warriors. It is irrelevant if the rape happened or not. 10000 people murdered a person in cold blood. Let's not talk about things that do not matter. I say every one of those 10k should get life imprisonment. Open a new prison, let them root inside and let that serve as example for others. Wow!! If true can you imagine the plight of that man ? 
Cough up 2 lakh, else false rape case and that resulted in a mob of 10,000 killing an innocent man. i repeat if true. Whether he is guilty or not, what happened there was a lynching. Where is the sympathy for him? Imagine a crowd of 10000 baying for your blood. Imagine the final terrifying moments of his life. Of course, he is not #indiasdaughter, so who gives a fuck.  Only one [newspaper](http://www.telegraphindia.com/1150307/jsp/nation/story_7334.jsp) seems to have interviewed the accused's family. 

>Suber alleged the woman had demanded Rs 2 lakh from Farid but he had refused.

>""Accompanied by a few people, the woman took my brother to a hotel on February 23 and forced him to drink. Later, she demanded Rs 2 lakh. When my brother refused, a false rape case was registered the next day.""

>The police are analysing CCTV footage from the Dimapur hotel. Whose tweet?  Damn.

Any verified source out there?  I can't shake off the feeling that it has happened so close to where I live. One of our relative has a motor garage there and so far he has replaced windshields of over 15 Travellers in two days (That is a authorized service center for Force Motors), most of them were destructed by the angry mob. Sadly, those are not covered by insurance and warranty. ""If you murder a murderer, rape a rapist, the only difference is that he did it first"" Let's hold our horses till we get verified facts. The poster of this tweet is not even a journalist or something so I'm not sure where he is getting his information from. He also says that the identity of the accused seems to be fake. Not sure about Nagaland, but mob justice keeps happening in Manipur. Irrespective of caste, creed, or religion. There are Numerous cases where suspects have been killed and their houses have been burnt. Even relatives are not allowed to enter their house. Reasons? Who knows. Lack of faith in the failed criminal Justice system? Mob mentality? Lack of education? 

Good thing that this is finally reaching the ears of national media. But painting this *only* as a religious or racial problem would be intellectually dishonest. A failing justice delivery system is at the core of the issue.

 [deleted] BC chutiyapa !! . I heard some Naga guy on NDTV that rape isn't their culture , shit must have the fan saala . NE junta there is shit in your home too , if the news is true , this was one of the most racist act in India ever to happen . If the twitter's version(from same profile) is true , the alleged rapist was in relation with the girl , and even the medical report hasn't reported rape


Also there was a co-accussed who a Sem Naga but since he was their bretheren he wasn't killed . NE junta jawab doo , you guys do a lot of protest and we support that , now is your turn , don't hide behind some rock  the poster of the tweet has connections to the victim and the victim's family and the false accuser's neighbors!

Apparently, Amazon is also losing out on the discounts it is offering to first time Amazon Pay users since public is abusing it. Hence they've come up with this brilliant idea of using AADHAAR, and using it to their advantage by handing out more freebies in exchange for new customer acquisition.

Now, I'm skeptical here because an OTP verification also serves the same purpose to an extent, so why do through the troubles of AADHAAR? 

Can anyone from these two companies confirm if this is indeed true?

The most formidable challenge to sanity and scepticism, so essential to our trade, has come from this dangerous undermining of news at prime time. The old-fashioned evening news bulletin has gone extinct. What you have, on the other hand, is debate after debate on each channel after 8 p.m. And because that debate must be polarizing, vicious, loud and therefore fun, it has to be provocative, anchors have to look stern, disgusted, preachy and so holier-than-cow. Further, since all competing channels look at the same list of stories that broke latest by 6 p.m., there is no time to fact-check, to hold a story up for verification. If the public prosecutor claims Kasab demanded biryani in jail, who can afford to wait until it is checked out with jail authorities. Somebody has said it, everybody has heard it, so let's go with it, only challenge being how to look more outraged than the rest. 



 
The biryani theory had, in fact, been cooked up decades before 26/11 and Ajmal Kasab. Google the siege of the holy Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar in 1993. As negotiations continued with militants who had seized control of the Kashmir Valley's holiest Muslim shrine, the government obviously arranged for food for them. This was then immediately seized upon by the BJP and its backers, saying Narasimha Rao's government was pampering terrorists with biryani, rather than storming the shrine and killing them. Of course, no biryani had actually been served. Food was apparently supplied from the CRPF/BSF langar and, as my friend and famous Kashmiri writer Basharat Peer tells me, biryani is not even a familiar dish in Kashmir. Now, when you are fighting vile terrorists, you don't have the patience to get your culinary imagination right. Or Rao would have been charged with feeding terrorists goshtaba or tabaq maz instead, and the metaphor would have remained confined to Kashmir rather than become a scar on our minds, marking out coronary-clogging biryani as a symbol of Muslim appeasement. It was impossible then not to take the claim of the prosecuting lawyer at face value and launch the shout-rage. Until he bragged years later, in March 2015, that he had lied to make public opinion angrier with Kasab, and underlined to the entire world how gullible, unquestioning and non-journalistic we had become meanwhile. 

 
  
Cover of NDTV's book More News is Good News: Untold Stories from 25 Years of Television News 
Many more recent instances underline this increasing gullibility. The death of two Badaun girls (in May 2014) was immediately accepted as rape-cum-murder by boys of a higher caste. Shortly thereafter, the story of a serial rape as a consequence of love jihad emerged from nearby Meerut. Then, there were the two 'brave' girls in Rohtak who beat up their 'molesters' in a bus. Lynching of a Muslim man (accused of rape by a Naga woman) by a mob that stormed the prison in Dimapur. The rape of a seventy-one-year-old nun in West Bengal. In each case, almost nobody waited to bring you the story first, with at least the basic facts verified. The pressure to find issues for the evening's tu-tu-main-main is much too great today to allow for any patience or scepticism. Each one of these stories caused plenty of what we prefer to call shout-rage. But in the course of days, each one of these cases unravelled slightly different narratives. The CBI concluded that Badaun was a case of suicide; the woman in Meerut had apparently made up the story; so probably had the 'brave' girls of Rohtak; the Muslim boy in Dimapur was not only no Bangladeshi illegal but the brother of a Kargil martyr of our army; and finally, while it is reprehensible that an elderly nun was raped, the suspects were (probably Bangladeshi) Muslims and there was no linking it with the spate of vandalism at churches happening at the time. But each one had already been squeezed fully for prime-time value and just nobody was about to apologize.



 
This is the era of hashtag patriotism and anger. And biryani makes a sexier hashtag than a budget. No surprise then that even the navy officer who bragged in Rajkot that he had ordered the destruction of the suspicious Pakistani boat in the Arabian Sea said he wasn't going to capture terrorists alive only to feed them biryani.Comments <div class=""comments_list_detail"" id=""comments_list_detail"" style=""width:98%;display: none;""></div>Post your commentsRelatedWhy Truck Drivers on India's Highways Need GST: NDTV ExclusiveMore Stories'Pakistan Must Answer On Atrocities In PoK': PM Modi's Top 5 QuotesIn Texas, A Man Who Didn't Kill Anybody Is About To Be Executed For MurderBoy, 6, Fatally 'Pummeled' Baby Sister When They Were Left Alone: Cops

[deleted] One of the root of all problems in this entire episode is the phrase :' sources said'.  Somebody made edited video of Imran Khan like Pakistan  posted yesterday lol

https://twitter.com/nk161277/status/1101871169022685184?s=19 Its clearly obvious that our wing commander was forced to say all those things by pak army. 

It look like hes looking at someone and then looking back at camera again. Like someone behind the camera is either holding a page of pre written speech or telling him what to say. 

And ofcourse all the cuts. Possibly because the pak person behind camera saying ""no dont say that say this instead"". Hence a million cuts. 

This whole thing is done so unprofessionally that its not even credible. But what else can you expect from pakistan.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lxafFJLrqI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lxafFJLrqI)

&#x200B;

As per this interview, if you go to around 2 minutes and watch from there, some time from that point in the video does the Pakistani foreign minister accidentally admit to having contact with Jaish-e-Mohammed leadership? I mean, of course we all already knew this but wasn't this heavily implied by the minister himself here? lol. OMFG this is fking gold 

PAK FM admits they have contacts with JeM

[2:13](https://youtu.be/0lxafFJLrqI?t=133) LOC skimirish :


Indian View based on Media  : Yeh ,Lo so much for Peace Gesture from IK.They are still firing .


Pakistani based on Media : We gave their Pilot now they have increased  shelling.



In nut shell : Terrorists having sleep while Soldiers from both sides fight and get martyred, and civilians die as usual. https://twitter.com/IamUmer1/status/1101523053434077185

To all the Pakistanis here saying that this video wasn't a mistake. That natsecjeff twitter account is now retweeting stuff from twitter accounts saying India is planning to use the brahmos missile. These people live in some different world. Pak foreign minister asks for 'Solid evidence' from India even after JeM claimed Pulwama attacks ?

The video released by the bomber himself associating him and JeM is not solid enough ?

What does he need ? A Press Conference ?

&#x200B; Honestly speaking, if it wasn't for our media, we would have a lot more credibility for our claims. The benefit of the doubt would be on our side.

Now because of the outrageous claims of the media we have to go an extra step further and provide bulletproof evidence for everything, which takes time.  [deleted] Guys watch this, bumbling idiot Shah Mehmood Qureshi admits on tape Pak establishment contacted JeM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lxafFJLrqI&t=154s >The script writer missed Pakistan Zindabad at the end of Abhinandan's hostage statement.

Maybe the video editor for that Pakistani propaganda video should try some udemy video editing courses. Aaj kal discount chal raha tha.  The last time we had public heroes like Abhinandan was 9 years ago during the 2008 Mumbai attacks and before that it was Kargil.

One thing common between all of these guys is awe inspiring bravery in the face of extreme danger and a resolute dedication to their duty.

Abhinandan will be an inspiration to many for years to come.  US seeks information on potential misuse of F-16 by Pakistan

Damage assessment through radar imagery suggests a hit but casualty figures are ""purely speculative"". M K Venu on twitter

> Whether it is Washington Post, The Guardian, Reuters or Daily Telegraph of London , they all reported near zero casualty in Balakote bombing except for one villager critically injured by a shrapnel. Even the MEA briefing the first day did not give any figure. So Pakistan released a heavily edited distasteful video of Wing Commander Abhinandan and are now racing to delete it everywhere. Forced, full of cuts, right out of North Korea school of journalism:

I guess two can play at the same game

""jobi hamre masle ho deshadgari karke hum hal karenge"" LOL Who's idea do you guys think that video was?
Was it the Govt that sticks an olive branch in it's mouth or the army that shits out militants who attack India? In all these tensions [let's lighten up a bit.](https://twitter.com/azamjamil53/status/1101445434193649665?s=21) Few hours back: [At least 23 Afghan security forces killed in Taliban attack on US-Afghan base](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/at-least-23-afghan-security-forces-killed-in-taliban-attack-on-us-afghan-base/articleshow/68224002.cms) This is why our armed forces didn't jump the gun and start releasing half-assed ""proof"" videos just to sway the opinion a few people.  I have posted in this in on reply also want to put it here. 

Lot of talk about evidence of IAF strike there are number of reasons for government not release any video or picture as per one of my Canadian mate who read extensively on Wars.
1. Image and video of strike  can further fuel extremist propoganda for revenge. It can lead to more deliberate terrorist attack, provide motivation for existing radical extremist for revenge attack. 
2.  It also give reveal our technical capabilities and Intel to Pak. So both Pak military and Extremist estimate our strength and reach. 
3. Pakistan denying our strike is 'good' for India if Pakistani people see images of killed people and destruction there will extreme anger against India it could lead more sympathy for Jem. This could lead to more recruit for Jem. To calm people Pak gov may come under pressure to pursuit more offensive attack on India. Public opinion shape lot of gov policy. 
4. Even after releasing Image and Video there is good chance  lot of  propoganda reportting will be carried to deny the fact and  devide public opinion (see what happing with F-16 story).
5. At Last there are lot assessment gone into this decision of releasing Images and Video which have both short and long term implications. 

So his take is we have to wait at least 3 to 10 years for Images and Video of Strike depends on regional security situation. There are lot of occasion in history where enemy party release their war achievement evidence to bring down moral of opposition and withheld evidence to keep em in dark so that was the delay, eh? itna karke bhi most they got was 'pakistan army professional and indian media bad'. yaar pakistani koi hota to india ko myBaap bana deta.  All the things they got him to say in the video and they didn't ask him to deny F-16 involvement.. seems obvious now. People need to understand that a POW would not answer any of the questions of the country he was captured. He shouldn't and wouldn't release mission information. 

The whole video is plain propaganda and he should have been forced to read it to the camera. Let alone all the cuts in the 45 second video.   Any discussion on [https://thewire.in/security/balakot-airstrikes-india-pakistan-satellite-images](https://thewire.in/security/balakot-airstrikes-india-pakistan-satellite-images)

First, 150-200m seems like nothing for a jet going at MachX speed. To me, it means the jet was already where it was supposed to be. So the PAF claim that it thwarted the attack and made the Indian fighters drop the payload hastily seems like crock. 

Second, assuming Ruser is right in the fact that we did not hit the targets in Balakot, what can this be attributed to? Was the Israeli-made SPICE-2000 precision-guided bomb not so precise after all? Or did intel mess up the coordinates? 

Unrelated and purely speculative but Pakistan's response to the alert, blocking out airspace, blackouts etc. makes me feel they are vulnerable from air. Also Wing Cdr. Abhinandan will come back with a wealth of information about the dogfight with an F-16. Air force is always about massive, excessive, destructive force and India made a clear point that it will use it. 

This conveys to Pakistan that only a political solution to Kashmir is possible. IK, in returning the pilot, acknowledges that. This could be the best time ever to negotiate and change the narrative between the two countries for the future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B; *QUESTION*


Pakistan has violated the Geneva convention in the past during the Kargil war. It is really horrible to read how Lt.Saurabh Kalia and his troops were treated in inhumane ways. Has India filed a complaint about this incident? Really sad :'(

https://twitter.com/Natsecjeff/status/1101787653718999041?s=19 For people still doubting that PAF used F16s, ask yourself one question:

If the PAF didn't use F16s and the IAF put out a blatant lie, why haven't they come out and called out the IAF on it already?

Wouldn't it be beneficial to Pakistan and detrimental to India if they called out India? 

Maj Gen Ashif Gharoor was quick to respond with tweets about the air strikes and the capture of our pilot so where is he now?

Its almost been an entire day since the press conference nd Pakistan has said nothing, even though there are huge implications for them if they use a F16.

This is enough proof that a F16 was indeed used.

Yet some Pakistanis are coming up with bullshit evidence that strays further and further away from reality to show that F16 wasn't used.  Man Pakistan's botch up is even greater than their mandatory run out in cricket.  > As Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States during the Mumbai attacks, I witnessed firsthand the American efforts to smooth out India-Pakistan tensions. President George W. Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and national security adviser Stephen Hadley spoke on the phone with prime ministers of both countries multiple times. The CIA shared intelligence that enabled Pakistan to arrest several individuals connected with the attacks. But after the immediate threat of Indian retaliation had passed, Pakistan backed away from punishing the attack’s masterminds and perpetrators.

1. Image and video of strike  can further fuel extremist propoganda for revenge.

The above part is not mine but a  comment   posted by another user which I have copy pasted here.

 Taiwan Air Force comment on Pakistan's claim.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3648621 I fucking hate our media man! Times now reporter calling Dr Fareha Bugti, Director India in Pakistan's Foreign Office, as Abhinand's wife😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭. I don't know whether to laugh or cry? pakistan did good job by this whole delay and releasing this video, its heavily edited and seems forced . Good job shooting* yourself in foot. Peace talks my ass Real shameful act by Pakistan to force him to a propaganda video All throughout this period of tension, there have been a few Twitter accounts that have foreign names and appear to be going at it with what looks like a running commentary of the troop movements and other activities on the ground. If you read long enough, the Pakistani bias comes through. All of their claims look like wild conspiracy theories ranging from Indian navy is going to be bombing the shit out of Karachi, to India is going to launch a missile tonight.

All of us, me included, have taken the bait and I'm not sure what to make of it but those accounts are now pissing me off now. Given enough time, one of these people will inevitably say: sources say India is pointing nuclear missiles towards Pakistan. I think the mods have been pretty proactive in taking down those links from the threads but they can't do that on Twitter.  A couple quick questions-

1. It has been said that the Pakistan airstrike was targeted at Indian military installations. Has this been claimed by Indian govt/IAF? Pak PM clearly stated that the attack was just a show of strength and intended no collateral damage. What is true? Will we never know since the F16s were driven back before they reached their destination? 

2. Has there been any formal claim so far regarding the number of casualties as result of the Balakot strike? International news sources have cited 0 casualties and so has Pakistan. What is eco-terrorism.  He's back! He's Back! Anyone know who's the lady beside Abhinandan?  https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/foreign-secretary-parries-parliamentary-standing-committee-query-on-donald-trump-comments/articleshow/68227268.cms

>Gokhale is said to have refused to respond to two questions from committee chairman Shashi Tharoor — about international media reports on the air strike at Balakot in Pakistan and about US President Donald Trump’s comments that he had some “reasonable good news” about a possible end to Indo-Pak hostilities. 

>He parried both questions by saying he can’t comment on media reports or on what the US president said. Asked about the latest developments in Indo-Pak ties, Gokhale chose to merely say, “Wait and watch,” which gave some members the impression that the situation along the border is still delicate, prompting Tharoor and most members not to ask any loaded questions. 

>He avoided questions on the number of casualties caused by the Indian air strike, saying the defence officers concerned may be better placed to answer them, it is learnt.

Why does this idiot pause every 3 seconds? lol. I'm not a Bhakt or being blinded by patriotism or anything but guys, as good as Imran Khan's speech about peace was, it doesnt mean much if they continue to shell us and send terrorists across the border.

Its like Modi and BJP saying petrol prices are at their lowest or our currency value is at its highest when its not.

Stop being charmed by that handsome mofo and wait for actual results.  India should start looking for a long term solution to Kashmir problem. They should subsidize entrepreneurial people to move there and create jobs and improve the economy. They should also help move more non-muslims(Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs , Christians etc) to move there because Muslim majority places are a lot of trouble. 
Help the economy , create jobs. Terrorism will go away.
Who wouldn’t want live around beautiful mountains if they get military protection and subsidized!  4 security personnels killed in a terrorist encounter at Kupwara 

https://twitter.com/ndtv/status/1101465420001935361 I'm a bit conflicted about the air strikes.

On one hand, IAF has not released any evidence yet.

On the other, I highly doubt our Armed Forces would go to such grave steps (i.e violating the undisputed airspace of another country) without proper Intel and drop bombs on just trees and not hit anything (I'm saying this even after considering that Modi might have pushed for it). Remember, the Armed Forces care a lot about their reputation, so much so that they didn't cross the LOC during the Karfil war. 

I personally think that they're waiting for Pakistan to respond to yesterday's press conference before releasing further info and evidence in hopes of catching Pakistan in another lie.

Also, maybe they didn't want to jeapardize the return of WC Abhinandan.  [This is truly shocking](https://www.firstpost.com/india/pilot-of-downed-pakistan-air-force-f-16-shahaz-ud-din-lynched-by-nowshera-mob-that-mistook-him-for-indian-airman-6180091.html).

for more on this. Listen in! #IndiaPakistanTension Is ceasefire still being violated ? All the media outlets are focused on Balakot. Is there any info about the airstrikes on Muzaffarabad sector and Chakoti in PoK?  

 If he is not released today then things will escalate exponentially I think pakistan wanted to make this a global media event of handing over but india refused it . So they asked abhinandan to release the most recent interview where he has admitted searchin for targets, media gloryfying, pak army saving him and he sees peace in pakistan :( goddamn this roundup of the day is something else from ravish 🤣 HE SHAKED HANDS WITH INDIANS emotional moment, tears of joy.

Who the hell made this :o Modi vs Imran WWE spoof . Shah Mehmood Qureshi accepts on air in front of the whole world that Azhar is in Pakistan. Azhar was released/exchanged by India in 1999 after that plane hijacking. This proves his criminal background. Further several sources confirm his association with JeM. So why don't they arrest him now? Pakistan just released Propoganda video of Abhinandan on their media with 40 cuts or so .Its very badly edited.

I dont know what these guys are smoking ffs [removed] I think the key question that should be talked about is that why are we using MIG-21's in the first place. And why didnt we have a response for AMRAAM capability that Pakistan has. 

The argument that MIG-21 shot down an F-15/JF-17 despite being an inferior plane is an argument for loosers. They shot down our plane because they could - doesnt matter why. 

The political class needs to answer that question and be taken to the cleaners for it. It is infuriating that no one has asked this question on the media yet.

Does anyone know why Pakistan Closed it's airspace for the past 3 ( or 4?) days? This is an [absolutely disgusting stunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icuFO8FYQi4) by the Pakistanis.

*It hurt itself in its confusion!* [deleted] So war is inevitable now? More ceasefire violation and 2 crpf and 2 Jawan killed. How will India respond?  Pakistan is trying hard to loose all the goodwill and instead give Modi one more excuse to escalate. Good for them. [removed] I watched indian news channel after almost 5 years. Hotstar US had republic tv as the first option, holy mother of cancer. Iranian (Who hates the Regime) I'm hoping for the best outcome for you guys. Crack on, India !

Analysis by Former Pak Ambassador to US [deleted] Okay he's here! He is almost in Indian territory. Like right as I type this. The gates have closed he in India now. Finally, he steps onto indian soil.  So I'm not sure if any of you are aware of this but the rank of Wing Commander is equivalent to that of Lt. Colonel in the army.

Edit: I wrote Group Captain by mistake. Group Captain is equivalent to Colonel.  Any one have a link to the 90 sec video that was cut many times?  Indian media and Modi pails in comparison to the propaganda Pakistan is pushing now with the edits with a little video in it. 

It 100% breaks the Geneva Convention for using a POW for propaganda and parading him in the media. 

Before people say ""hE wAsNt A pOw"". Any prisoner of the enemy nation due or from an armed conflict is a POW.  the amount of people in this thread trying to absolve pakistan of blame and blame the Indian media instead is pathetic. This is why being overly cynical is unhealthy and bad for discourse.  If it is proved that Pakistan did indeed use F-16 against India, pressure should be applied on USA to recall all their F16's. Not that they are able to control terrorist within. I was listening to a guy showing on NDTV regarding Spice 2000. It is a laser guided autonomous missile which has a range of upto 50 KMs. 

According to him there is no way it can miss apparently. It not only uses geocodes but also images of the target to lock in. 

I have difficulty in believing that it 'missed' the targets or the Indian formation panicked and 'dropped' the payloads. The payload has a brain of its own. I don't understand the purpose behind the video and calling out Indian media especially. We know they're sensationalist, most media houses are irrespective of their country. Would they really have the world believe that a media frenzy was the cause of tension between the two nations? multiple international media houses coming out with reports giving out satellite images that we just damaged trees and no damage was done. Which contradicts the claims made by our media of 250-300 terrorist in camps. Now the main question is , if this was never confirmed why didnt our gov intervene and say the media to stop spreading false info. Next thing why did media throw this curveball of 300 terrorist being killed ? Whats the actual reality? Huge trust and credibility issue being raised on global scale. 

EDIt : also i strongly feel media houses need to be under some law of spreading unverfied garbage news and misleading the nation [deleted] Why is the congress so stupid.

Pakistan's ""gesture of peace"" includes heavy shelling along LOC for whole day and forced statement from pow.

If anyone here still believes Pakistan's narrative, I don't know what to say to you. the r/worldnews thread is extremely pathetic. Can't believe how sympathetic people are to Pakistan after one 'good gesture' as if that erases everything they've done the past 60 years. I'm not going to pretend India is innocent but the comments really shocked me.

>my hat is off to Pakistan for being the first to put down the sword and offer out the hand of Peace. This is an exceedingly decent way to start negotiations. I hope the Indians can accept this graciously and everybody can stop fighting. Best of luck to my friends on both sides.



One comment. I accept that everybody should stop fighting but this garbage comment was upvoted as if this was a one off incident. Hats off to IK for the master PR move, it's worked wonders. In the meanwhile, there's this news...

Don't know if any other sources are reporting this but firstpost is supposed to be the less biased among all online sources. At a time when our country is plagued by opportunistic politicians, jingoist newscasters and hatred, we can all do with a national hero. Wing Commander Abhinandan has done more than what bringing down an enemy plane could ever have done, he has brought a large section of the country together. Someone in Pakistan filed a petition in court to stop his release, that's what the delay was I was watching Louis C. K best moments on Conan and he said something really thoughtful.

Jammu and Kashmir: Visuals of houses damaged in Rajouri sector following shelling by Pakistan Army. (02-03-19) https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/masood-azhar-may-have-renal-failure-undergoes-regular-dialysis-report-2001618 Unconfirmed reports in media that masood azhar died We criticize our own media routinely. We know it's bad. So what is Pakistan achieving with the coerced video. Christ man. They're really rubbing it into our faces, arent they? 


idk. I mean I like that the Indian media is getting a drubbing but this is short sighted. Pakistan were doing quite well until now. MC pakistani knows we value our citizens hence even after so much propaganda we welcomed him with so much love and rightfully so.... If this would have happened the other way around and we had a pakistani pilot in our costody pakistani military would have simply refused to acknowledge him as their citizen and would have disowned him. Remember these Pakistanis refused to accept their own jawans and officers in the kargil war and our army buried them with full respect. Being a pakistani is a curse I wouldn't wish on anyone.  This is what diplomatic isolation truly looks like.

We entered their airspace, bombed them in Pakistan proper, and then they're the ones who -basically- got condemned by the international community.

Then when they retaliated and took one of our pilots as hostage, showed videos of him being treated well, then returned him as a gesture of peace, we began shelling them ever harder.  Not a single country has spoken against us or condemned us other than Turkey (so far).

I wonder what it would look like if the situation was reversed. *Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who had earlier decided to go and receive IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman at the Wagah border, later said that he will not do so in order to ensure the defence protocol. He has urged Pakistan to Release PoWs still in captivity from 1971 war.*

&#x200B;

is this true? we release 93k pak POW, why didn't they? what about good old exchange method Facebook already filled with hour old #WelcomeHome memes and in actual he is still on the other side.

Fucking tards. Jai hind

 Just saw Indian air force tweet detailing the diary of event and saying once again that F16 was shot down. Bam... ABP news claiming that Abhinandan confessed ""I wasn't tortured physically but mentally.""

Can anybody verify this? Major difference in pak army and indian army:

Pak army: madly starts releasing tweets, pictures and statements without assessment and then ended up deleting or changing them. 

Indian army: Assessed and studied the whole situation with patience. Only then gave out solid statements with proofs in the end. Pure professionalism.  Pakistan's foreign minister is the biggest piece of shit ever.  This is also the biggest shitshow I've ever seen by the Indian media. Sadly majority of the population won't care, and our media will always be shit. [removed] Although it's old news, I'm gonna leave it here:

>But it is India that has suffered the more glaring contradictions. The government has yet to offer any evidence publicly for its claim that it downed a Pakistan plane, which Indian officials say crashed beyond their border. Likewise, India has offered no proof that its initial airstrike on Tuesday killed “a very large number” of “terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis,” as India’s foreign secretary has claimed.

>Videos of a crushed building filled with bodies that soon began circulating widely on social media in India were quickly debunked. The images were not from the airstrike but from an earthquake in Pakistan more than 10 years ago.

>This is beginning to take its toll on Mr. Modi, who is up for election in about two months and who until recently seemed invincible. But in some sectors, he is now being accused of military adventurism. One family of a fallen soldier called the government a liar.

Laughing my ass off. 1993, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008... and it never ends. 

Give peace a chance, indeed. Let's humiliate and coerce a guy we shot down into a heavily edited statement praising Pakistan and her army. Right outta the fascist dictator playbook. ""Theeek hai?"" Pakistan should be ashamed today. They have coerced a true hero, but the joke is on them. 

Assessment about media is obviously on point, but it’s the way this was done by Pakistan that’s the issue. IK is clearly not in control.  Why is everyone calling this a ""Modi War Game"". He isn't the person who made the decision to do the airstrikes. He isn't the one behind the intelligence.

 This was done by the IAF based in intelligence and information. Modi does not have the necessary education in military procedures, intelligence or the ability to order and make such strikes. Actually none of our politicians do. Only the Army does. 

Stop crediting the force and strikes to Modi just so you guys can quench your far-left thirst by beating him with it by calling it a failure based on unreliable media and information from the enemy. 

No one knows what happened in Balakot except Pakistani Army and Indian Army. None of them released any credible information or evidence to prove or disprove the damage. 

Edit: He might take credit, but that's it. It's taking credit for what the Army did. He did not orchestrate the strikes. Now and even during the surgical Strike. 

I suggest the replies if any for this comment should be from Indians only and not the Pakistani users who have invaded the sub since yesterday.  I don't know why some people are asking for proof of those air strikes. There is something called as ""Classified"". For fucks sake have some faith on our Armed Forces.

Just fucking ban the media of both sides Now that the Wing Commander is back I know a lot of stress of people have been relieved but don't get cocky and start hurling abuses at every Pakistani you see. We are better than that

Also, I have to say, there were some very wonderful Pakistani people on this thread, making rational arguments and not blindly following thie country. It was nice to discuss and talk with you guys and see your viewpoints. 

But on the other hand there were a LOT of troll accounts trying to spread misinformation and picking fights. I hope everyone is calm now.  One thing now remains, someone needs to confirm from the Wing Commander that he DID in fact shoot down that F-16 the media has been telling us about. 

Certainly that will clear all of it up. 👍  [Smriti Irani credits PM Narendra Modi for IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman’s return](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/smriti-irani-credits-pm-narendra-modi-for-iaf-pilot-abhinandan-varthaman-return-to-india-1468580-2019-03-02) [deleted] [deleted] ""The country is feeling the absence of Rafale.The entire country is saying in one voice today, what all could have happened if we had Rafale"" - PM

[Ofcourse LPG/PNG are odourless. It is the ethyl mercaptan which is mixed with them, that helps us identify a leak]~


* On the evening of 19th Sept 2019, panic started spreading among residents of Mumbai. What people initially thought, was their own/neighbour's PNG line leaking, turned out to be something bigger. Because the odour was not localised to one single house/apartment. It was observed in many areas spread across western to eastern mumbai

* Many residents were now on twitter, talking about what was happening on their end. 

* Complaints were coming in from areas like Chembur, Mankhurd, Govandi, Chandivali, Powai, Ghatkopar, Santacruz and Andheri (to name a few?)

* BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) said they were looking into the leak and had taken counter measures like deploying FireEngines and other emergency rescue vehicles.

* Unverified(without source) reports started flowing in saying BMC declared the leak was from RCF (Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers), which RCF categorically denied ( [RCF Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/rcfkisanmanch) - they tweeted their statement late this morning. Which I found idiotic. It should have been done last evening, if infact there was no leak at their end)

* Much to the surprise of residents, BMC even said the gas leak could have come from a moving vehicle. 

* Mahanagar gas limited, which provides piped LPG connection in Mumbai, also denied any leak.

* Mumbai police handle did not put out any statement (as of late last night).

* Now, the morning after the incident, no adverse effects/injuries/deaths/destruction to property reported so far. So that is good. 



**Question of the hour** - What was the source? BMC is still looking for an answer.

I came across two tweets, which spoke about the possible sources.

1. Algal bloom - toxic accumulation of algae in fresh and salt water sources. It kills marine life along with strong odour sometimes. The low pressure area around arabian sea, resulting in movement of wind, must have brought the odour into the city.

2. The garbage dump at Mankhurd (deonar dumping ground, infamous for having caught on fire in 2016), while decomposing, must have emanated methane (odourless) / hydrogen sulfide / ammonia.




**The leak, if LPG(possibility of which is NIL, since no explosion was reported anywhere), would have caused massive deaths and damages by now. There have been similar incidents in India and abroad** - 

[**2014_GAIL_pipeline_explosion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_GAIL_pipeline_explosion) - 22 dead, 30 injured. Location - Nagaram in Andhrapradesh.

The explosions occurred later at 23:57 on Yisin Road, Ersheng Road, Sanduo Road and Guanghua Road.

>Witnesses reported seeing fireballs soaring into the sky and flames reaching 15 stories high. The blasts ripped up roads, trapped and overturned cars and firetrucks, and caused a blackout to the electrical grid. About 6 km of road length were damaged. The explosions reportedly blew cars and motorcycles high up in the air; some vehicles and victims were found at the rooftops of buildings three or four stories high. One street had been split along its length, swallowing fire trucks and other vehicles.

>Premier Jiang Yi-huah stated that there had been at least five blasts around the city. The blasts cut gas supplies to 23,600 households, electricity to 12,000 households, and water to 8,000 households.

>Firefighters from Kaohsiung City, Chiayi City, Pingtung County, Tainan City and Taitung County rushed to the scene to extinguish the fires and help the rescue efforts. Some of the firefighters also sprayed water on the roads in the hope to reduce the ground temperature. During the incident, four firefighters lost their lives, with two of them going missing; the explosions also injured 22 other emergency workers. The Taiwanese army was also dispatched and arrived at the site within two hours after the initial explosion.

>Emergency rooms in hospitals around Kaohsiung were packed with casualties that night, with most of them having suffered cuts and burns. Some of the injured people had to be carried to hospitals by trucks due to the lack of ambulances. All of the casualties were sent to more than 20 hospitals around the city, including Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Yuan's General Hospital, Armed Forces General Hospital, and Kaohsiung Municipal United Hospitals.

Unverified,[Meta] What's with the [r]ule about blurring out usernames of unverified Twitter accounts?,4,2n9vxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2n9vxg/meta_whats_with_the_rule_about_blurring_out/,11,1416875329.0,"Recently I came across this comment on a post:
    
    Links to unverified twitter accounts are not allowed on /r/India.
    To post the tweet, take a screenshot, blur out names of all 
    unverified accounts and submit using the exact title as tweet.

Can any mod please explain where exactly this rule is mentioned? Because at the time of writing this, I do not see any such rule on 
the [rule wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/rules).

Also, **why** is this rule even in place? Many prominent people don't have verified accounts. You can just set a minimum followers requirement, maybe at least 5000 or 10,000 followers if you want to filter out trash.

I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2n96k4/this_guy_at_times_makes_sense/cmbhx82) and wondered, what's the point of sharing a tweet if you blur out the handle? There's no reference point to the tweet! I could very well invent an inflammatory tweet on Photoshop, say it is from a senior political party member and claim it to have been deleted. And if you want us to blur the handle only a little so that it's still discernible, why blur at all? It doesn't add up. 

Thanks.",rajeevist," Anonymity is very important to reddit. Unverified accounts are, for the most part, going to be personal accounts of people who don't want to be under the scrutiny of almost 30,000 people. Since not blurring out the names provides zero anonymity to them, this rule needs to exist. However, I feel KRK deserves an exception. As for others, follower count is not an indicator of actual popularity. There are accounts that mass follow thousands of accounts and then unfollow those from whom they get a follow-back. They may also be opinionated people /r/India might agree with, but then their anonymity is compromised. That is, of course, the moderator's contention, and I agree with that. >Also, why is this rule even in place? Many prominent people don't have verified accounts. You can just set a minimum followers requirement, maybe at least 5000 or 10,000 followers if you want to filter out trash.

That means we need to double check the followers of every tweet that's posted here. Also opens us up to debate about what an acceptable number is. 2000? 5000? 10000?

No, the blurring needs to be done well enough to conceal that person's identity. And if you do make up a tweet we will flair it as unverified. 


We'll need to edit the rules wiki to include this rule, thanks for pointing it out."

Many of you have reported this thread, and I believe those reports are well intentioned. Situations like these are tricky because there is no way to completely verify if someone is being truthful. On the other hand, there is no reason to suspect that this request is not genuine either. We have allowed similar threads in the past and therefore we don't think we should remove this thread. Yes, sometimes a scammer will misuse your trust, but that should not stop us from helping the majority (hopefully) of genuine redditors.

Threads like these are still few and far between. We can come up with a policy to deal with situations like these in the future, but for now, I think it would be correct to allow this thread and request the you to exercise your own judgement. 

Thanks! You can start a fund raising campaign in websites like Ketto dedicated for this. You will also have a much larger reach to people through that way (they share in FB etc..).

Thanks in advance!",shadowintheclouds," Probably gonna get a lot of hate for this, but there is no reliable news source. Everything is biased. Every news source is biased obviously towards either side, you just have to pick the truth.

Can recommend some to avoid completely (which I can remember), not regional:-

* Swarajya, Republic, ToI, Zee News, Times Now, IndiaTV, Dainik (RW propaganda, do I even have to say this?)

* ThePrint (Many unverified news which go on to be proved wrong later and mostly opinion articles)

* Quint, Caravan, Vox, Vice, Verge, Arre (Buzzfeeds)

* Telegraph (shit tier journalism, like a woke kid on Twitter)

* ABP (💰)

* NatHerald (like, obviously)

All of these do have credible news too, but the cons far outweigh the pros, every of those news are available on others.

Can't go wrong with:-

* TheWire (got balls to speak truth, although left leaning, don't suck cock like others)

* TheHindu (favored communism years back but almost neutral now, investigations)

* Indian Express (dunno about the lean, but always seem reliable) DD News INDIAN EXPRESS! Hindu, Indian Express for general news. They have leftish leanings on edit page. But news coverage is fair, IMHO.

Mint newspaper also is good. You will still have your own bias and the natural inclination will be to find sources that feed your bias. The bias I am talking about is all things moral. Are moral rights and wrongs black and white? Is there a grey area? It's the grey area which creates a lot of conflicts.  Reuters India Edition India tv (tatti hai) Whatsapp. Twitter. Uncles. Aunties.
